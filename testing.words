As
part
of
the
restructuring
,
WCRS
and
Eurocom
said
they
will
look
for
ways
to
combine
their
media
buying
across
Europe
.

What
's
more
,
both
Eurocom
and
brothers
Francis
and
Gilbert
Gross
,
who
founded
Carat
,
will
acquire
14.99
%
stakes
in
WCRS
Group
,
creating
a
powerful
link
between
Eurocom
and
Carat
.

Carat
will
receive
its
WCRS
stake
as
part
of
payment
for
the
50
%
Carat
stake
that
WCRS
is
buying
,
while
Eurocom
said
it
expects
to
pay
about
#
32
million
for
its
WCRS
stake
.

Mr.
Della
Femina
says
he
plans
to
remain
heavily
involved
in
the
creative
product
at
the
world-wide
agency
,
serving
as
a
sort
of
``
creative
conscience
.
''

Louise
McNamee
,
Della
Femina
's
president
,
will
continue
running
the
U.S.
agency
day-to-day
.

They
and
other
top
executives
signed
long-term
employment
contracts
and
Mr.
Della
Femina
will
receive
an
additional
multimillion-dollar
sum
,
which
some
industry
executives
pegged
at
about
$
10
million
.

WCRS
Group
,
for
its
part
,
will
now
be
able
to
follow
its
longstanding
plan
of
becoming
``
a
holding
company
for
a
series
of
media-related
businesses
,
''
said
Peter
Scott
,
the
firm
's
chief
executive
.

In
addition
to
Carat
,
WCRS
will
hold
onto
its
public
relations
,
TV
programming
and
other
businesses
.

WCRS
says
its
debt
will
be
cut
to
#
24
million
from
#
66
million
as
a
result
of
the
transaction
.

For
Carat
,
meanwhile
,
the
alliance
with
Eurocom
and
WCRS
is
intended
to
strengthen
its
own
push
outside
France
.

Carat
's
Gross
brothers
invented
the
idea
of
large-scale
buying
of
media
space
.

By
buying
the
space
in
bulk
,
they
obtain
discounts
as
high
as
50
%
,
which
they
can
pass
on
to
customers
.

They
thus
have
won
the
French
space-buying
business
of
such
advertising
giants
as
Coca-Cola
Co.
,
Fiat
S.p
.
A.
,
Gillette
and
Kodak
.

But
now
,
other
agencies
are
getting
into
the
business
with
their
own
competing
media-buying
groups
--
and
Carat
wants
to
expand
to
the
rest
of
Europe
.

To
help
finance
the
Carat
purchase
,
WCRS
said
it
plans
an
issue
of
Euroconvertible
preferred
shares
once
the
market
settles
down
.

But
WCRS
added
that
``
in
the
light
of
the
current
uncertainty
in
the
equity
markets
,
''
it
has
arranged
medium-term
debt
financing
,
which
would
be
underwritten
by
Samuel
Montagu
&
Co.
Ltd
.

Earthquake
's
Damage

Tuesday
's
earthquake
brought
the
San
Francisco
ad
scene
to
a
screeching
halt
yesterday
,
with
only
a
few
staffers
showing
up
at
their
offices
,
mainly
to
survey
the
damage
or
to
wring
their
hands
about
imminent
new-business
presentations
.

While
no
agencies
reported
injuries
to
employees
,
the
quake
damaged
the
offices
of
J.
Walter
Thompson
,
Chiat\/Day\/Mojo
and
DDB
Needham
,
among
others
,
spokesmen
for
those
agencies
said
.

Staffers
at
Thompson
,
whose
offices
are
in
the
ultramodern
Embarcadero
Center
,
watched
pictures
drop
from
the
walls
and
then
felt
the
skyscraper
sway
seven
to
eight
feet
,
according
to
a
spokeswoman
.

Plaster
fell
and
windows
were
broken
at
Chiat\/Day\/Mojo
,
a
spokesman
for
that
agency
said
.

Late
yesterday
afternoon
,
DDB
Needham
executives
were
scrambling
to
figure
out
what
to
do
about
a
new
business
presentation
that
had
been
scheduled
for
today
,
a
spokesman
said
.

DDB
Needham
's
office
building
may
have
sustained
structural
damage
,
the
spokesman
added
.

``
All
operations
have
stopped
,
''
he
said
.

A
number
of
agencies
,
including
Thompson
and
Foote
,
Cone
&
Belding
,
said
some
employees
who
live
outside
of
San
Francisco
,
fearful
that
they
would
n't
be
able
to
get
home
,
spent
the
night
at
the
agency
.

Diamond-Star

Diamond-Star
said
it
will
export
about
1,500

cars
to

by
year
's

.

Honda
Motor
Co.
,
the
first
Japanese
auto
maker
to
ship
cars
to
Japan
from
the
U.S.
,
is
now
exporting
more
than
5,000
Accord
Coupes
a
year
from
its
Marysville
,
Ohio
,
factory
.

One
of
the
most
remarkable
features
of
the
forced
marches
of
the
ethnic
Turks
out
of
Bulgaria
over
the
past
five
months
has
been
the
lack
of
international
attention
.

The
deportation
of
more
than
315,000
men
,
women
and
children
by
the
Bulgarian
regime
adds
up
to
one
of
the
largest
migrations
seen
in
the
postwar
years
.

Yet
some
people
are
advancing
a
chilling
casuistry
:
that
what
we
are
seeing
is
somehow
the
understandable
result
of
the
historical
sins
committed
by
the
Turks
in
the
16th
century
.

Today
's
Turks
in
Bulgaria
,
in
other
words
,
deserve
what
is
coming
to
them
four
centuries
later
.

As
if
this
were
n't
enough
,
the
Senate
Judiciary
Committee
is
getting
into
the
act
.

On
Tuesday
it
approved
Senator
Bob
Dole
's
proposed
commemorative
resolution
designating
April
24
,
1990
,
as
the
``
National
Day
of
Remembrance
of
the
75th
Anniversary
of
the
Armenian
Genocide
of
1915-1923
,
''
suffered
at
the
hands
of
the
warring
Ottoman
Empire
.

There
can
be
no
quibbling
that
the
Armenians
endured
terrible
suffering
,
but
one
has
to
wonder
what
possible
good
such
a
resolution
will
achieve
.

It
puts
great
strain
on
a
longstanding
U.S.
friendship
with
Turkey
,
a
country
that
has
been
one
of
America
's
strongest
allies
in
NATO
.

The
resolution
also
comes
at
a
time
when
Turkey
has
been
seeking
help
from
the
United
States
in
resolving
its
Bulgarian
emigration
controversy
and
pursuing
democratic
reforms
that
may
lead
to
membership
in
the
European
Community
.

Turkey
has
been
fighting
its
past
for
years
,
and
thus
far
has
been
only
partially
successful
.

Must
it
now
accept
that
one
of
its
strongest
allies
blames
it
for
the
genocide
of
another
people
?

Such
sentiment
only
encourages
the
adverse
feelings
toward
Turkey
that
surfaced
when
Turkey
asked
for
assistance
in
dealing
with
its
Bulgarian
emigration
crisis
.

Mr.
Dole
's
odd
effort
notwithstanding
,
most
of
Turkey
's
political
problems
lie
with
the
Europeans
.

Part
of
the
problem
some
Europeans
have
with
Turkey
seems
to
stem
from
its
location
--
Turkey
is
n't
really
part
of
Europe
.

Why
,
they
wonder
,
should
it
belong
to
the
EC
?

Another
anti-Turkish
hook
is
the
Islamic
faith
of
the
majority
of
the
Turkish
people
:
Turkey
,
we
are
told
,
is
not
a
Christian
nation
;
its
people
simply
wo
n't
fit
in
with
the
Western
European
Judeo-Christian
tradition
.

It
's
when
these
rationalizations
fall
on
deaf
ears
that
the
old
standby
of
retribution
for
treatment
at
the
hands
of
the
Ottoman
Empire
comes
to
the
fore
.

No
one
has
to
accept
the
sins
of
the
Ottoman
Empire
to
reject
that
argument
.

Turkey
in
any
event
is
long
past
it
.

The
country
has
in
recent
years
accepted
more
than
500,000
refugees
from
at
least
four
bordering
nations
.

Kurds
,
suffering
what
many
people
consider
to
be
a
current
extermination
campaign
at
the
hands
of
Syria
,
Iran
and
Iraq
have
inundated
eastern
Turkey
.

Now
it
is
their
fellow
Turks
arriving
as
refugees
from
Bulgaria
.

The
Turkish
refugee
tragedy
and
the
ongoing
crisis
can
not
be
ignored
and
shuttled
off
to
that
notorious
dustbin
of
history
that
has
become
so
convenient
recently
.

Surely
,
the
past
suffering
of
any
people
at
any
time
can
not
be
simply
filed
away
and
forgotten
.

But
what
the
Senate
Judiciary
Committee
has
done
in
supporting
the
strongly
worded
Armenian
resolution
achieves
no
useful
end
;
it
merely
produces
more
controversy
and
embittered
memories
.

Congress
has
enough
difficulty
dealing
with
the
realities
of
the
world
as
it
currently
exists
.

Bulgaria
's
government
has
been
behaving
beyond
the
pale
for
months
,
and
the
U.S.
does
its
values
no
credit
by
ignoring
that
while
casting
its
votes
into
the
past
.

Many
in
Washington
say
President
Bush
will
have
to
raise
taxes
to
pay
for
his
war
on
drugs
.

We
have
a
better
idea
:
Dismantle
HUD
to
pay
for
the
war
on
drugs
.

Housing
and
Urban
Development
's
budget
is
$
17
billion
.

From
what
we
and
the
nation
have
been
reading
,
the
money
is
n't
being
spent
very
well
.

The
single
most
important
contribution
the
government
could
make
now
to
help
the
poor
is
to
get
the
specter
of
drugs
out
of
their
neighborhoods
.

If
that
takes
money
,
take
it
away
from
this
discredited
federal
department
.

But
of
course
the
Democrats
pillorying
HUD
in
hearings
and
in
the
press
have
no
such
solution
in
mind
.

Instead
,
they
're
scrambling
to
protect
the
very
programs
at
the
heart
of
the
HUD
scandal
.

This
month
,
HUD
Secretary
Jack
Kemp
unveiled
a
series
of
proposed
reforms
to
improve
management
at
HUD
.

No
doubt
many
of
his
ideas
are
worthy
,
but
ultimately
he
is
proposing
to
make
fundamentally
flawed
programs
work
slightly
more
fairly
and
efficiently
.

Congress
is
unlikely
to
go
even
that
far
.

Last
week
,
Secretary
Kemp
ran
into
a
buzzsaw
of
criticism
from
House
Banking
Committee
members
.

They
were
appalled
,
for
instance
,
that
he
wanted
to
target
more
of
the
$
3
billion
Community
Development
Block
Grant
(
CDBG
)
program
to
low-income
projects
and
zero
out
the
notorious
``
discretionary
''
funds
that
have
allowed
HUD
officials
to
steer
contracts
to
political
cronies
.

These
development
grants
mainly
enrich
developers
who
want
to
put
up
shopping
centers
and
parking
garages
.

They
also
give
those
in
Congress
political
credit
for
bringing
home
the
pork
,
and
so
they
are
popular
with
such
Members
as
Mary
Rose
Oakar
.

Rep.
Oakar
,
a
Democrat
from
Cleveland
,
wants
a
$
6.9
million
grant
so
Cleveland
can
build
an
18-story
Rock
and
Roll
Hall
of
Fame
.

She
says
it
'd
create
600
jobs
and
bring
Cleveland
tourist
revenue
.

HUD
says
the
project
does
n't
qualify
,
and
Mr.
Kemp
says
that
rock
'n'
roll
musicians
and
the
music
industry
ought
to
put
up
the
money
.

At
the
hearing
,
Rep.
Oakar
started
wailing
about
``
phoney
baloney
regulations
''
that
would
stand
between
her
and
``
housing
for
downtown
Cleveland
.
''

Rep.
Chalmers
Wylie
,
an
Ohio
Republican
,
rallied
to
the
cause
:
``
I
think
the
gentlelady
is
making
an
important
statement
.

The
implication
that
if
a
congressman
calls
about
a
project
in
his
district
there
's
something
wrong
,
I
think
is
most
unfortunate
.
''

We
're
sure
some
theologian
can
explain
the
difference
between
what
the
Republican
consultants
have
been
doing
with
HUD
and
what
these
gentleladies
and
gentlemen
want
to
do
with
HUD
.

Our
view
is
that
given
Congress
's
attitude
toward
HUD
,
the
place
probably
is
beyond
reform
.

For
more
than
50
years
the
federal
government
has
tried
various
ways
to
provide
housing
for
the
poor
and
revive
cities
.

In
the
process
HUD
has
wasted
untold
billions
,
created
slums
and
invited
corruption
.

Much
of
HUD
's
spending
actually
is
disguised
welfare
for
developers
or
the
middle
class
.

That
includes
the
CDBG
funds
and
the
Federal
Housing
Administration
,
which
loans
out
money
for
private
home
mortgages
and
has
just
been
discovered
to
be
$
4
billion
in
the
hole
.

Selling
the
FHA
's
loan
portfolio
to
the
highest
bidder
would
save
the
taxpayers
untold
billions
in
future
losses
.

Some
HUD
money
actually
does
trickle
down
to
the
poor
,
and
zeroing
out
housing
middlemen
would
free
up
more
money
for
public
housing
tenants
to
manage
and
even
own
their
units
.

The
rest
ought
to
be
used
to
clean
out
drugs
from
the
neighbhorhoods
.

Rival
gangs
have
turned
cities
into
combat
zones
.

Even
suburban
Prince
George
's
County
,
Md.
,
reported
last
week
there
have
been
a
record
96
killings
there
this
year
,
most
of
them
drug-related
.

Innocent
bystanders
often
are
the
victims
.

A
man
in
a
wheelchair
was
gunned
down
in
the
crossfire
of
a
Miami
drug
battle
.

A
three-year-old
Brooklyn
boy
was
used
as
a
shield
by
a
drug
dealer
.

Decent
life
in
the
inner
cities
wo
n't
be
restored
unless
the
government
reclaims
the
streets
from
the
drug
gangs
.

Until
then
,
the
billions
HUD
spends
on
inner-city
housing
simply
is
wasted
.

It
's
still
unclear
whether
Secretary
Kemp
wants
to
completely
overhaul
the
engine
room
at
HUD
or
just
tighten
a
few
screws
here
and
there
.

No
doubt
he
believes
the
place
can
be
salvaged
.

Having
seen
the
hypocrisy
with
which
Congress
has
addressed
the
HUD
scandals
,
we
disagree
.

It
's
time
to
scrap
the
politically
infested
spending
machine
HUD
has
become
and
channel
the
resources
into
the
drug
war
.

Randy
Delchamps
was
named
chairman
and
chief
executive
officer

succeeds

died

crash

at

.

Randy
Delchamps
retains
his

Natural
upheavals
,
and
most
particularly
earthquakes
,
are
not
only
horrible
realities
in
and
of
themselves
,
but
also
symbols
through
which
the
state
of
a
society
can
be
construed
.

Armenian
earthquake
a
year
ago
disclosed
,
quite
literally
,
a
city
whose
larger
structures
had
been
built
with
sand
.

The
extent
of
the
disaster
stemmed
from
years
of
chicanery
and
bureaucratic
indifference
.

The
larger
parallel
after
the
earthquake
centered
south
of
San
Francisco
is
surely
with
the
state
of
the
U.S.
economy
.

Did
the
stock-market
tremors
of
Friday
,
Oct.
13
,
presage
larger
fragility
,
far
greater
upheavals
?

Are
the
engineering
and
architecture
of
the
economy
as
vulnerable
as
the
spans
of
the
Bay
Bridge
?

The
eerie
complacency
of
the
Reagan-Bush
era
has
produced
Panglossian
paeans
about
the
present
perfection
of
U.S.
economic
and
social
arrangements
.

A
licensed
government
intellectual
,
Francis
Fukuyama
,
recently
announced
in
The
National
Interest
that
history
is
,
so
to
speak
,
at
an
end
since
the
course
of
human
progress
has
now
culminated
in
the
glorious
full
stop
of
American
civilization
.

His
observations
were
taken
seriously
.

But
we
are
,
in
reality
,
witnessing
the
continuing
decline
of
the
political
economy
of
capitalism
:
not
so
much
the
end
of
history
but
the
history
of
the
end
.

The
financial
equivalent
of
the
sand
used
by
those
Armenian
contractors
is
junk
bonds
and
the
leveraged
buy-outs
associated
with
them
.

Builders
get
away
with
using
sand
and
financiers
junk
when
society
decides
it
's
okay
,
necessary
even
,
to
look
the
other
way
.

And
by
the
early
1980s
U.S.
capitalists
had
ample
reason
to
welcome
junk
bonds
,
to
look
the
other
way
.

By
that
time
they
found
extremely
low
profit
rates
from
non-financial
corporate
investment
.

Government
statistics
in
fact
show
that
the
profit
rate
--
net
pretax
profits
divided
by
capital
stock
--
peaked
in
1965
at
17.2
%
.

That
same
calculation
saw
profit
rates
fall
to
4.6
%
in
the
recession
year
1982
and
the
supposed
miracle
that
followed
has
seen
the
profit
rate
rise
only
to
8.1
%
in
1986
and
8
%
in
1987
.

Corresponding
to
the
fall
in
profit
rates
was
--
in
the
early
1980s
--
the
drop
in
the
number
arrived
at
if
you
divide
the
market
value
of
firms
by
the
replacement
costs
of
their
assets
,
the
famous
Q
ratio
associated
with
Prof.
James
Tobin
.

In
theory
,
the
value
attached
to
a
firm
by
the
market
and
the
cost
of
replacing
its
assets
should
be
the
same
.

But
of
course
the
market
could
decide
that
the
firm
's
capital
stock
--
its
assets
--
means
nothing
if
the
firm
is
not
producing
profits
.

This
is
indeed
what
the
market
decided
.

By
1982
the
ratio
was
43.5
%
,
meaning
that
the
market
was
valuing
every
dollar
's
worth
of
the
average
firm
's
assets
at
43
cents
.

From
the
history
of
capitalism
we
can
take
it
as
a
sound
bet
that
if
it
takes
only
43
cents
to
buy
a
dollar
's
worth
of
a
firm
's
capital
stock
,
an
alert
entrepreneur
wo
n't
look
the
other
way
.

His
assumption
is
that
the
underlying
profitability
rate
will
go
up
and
the
capital
assets
he
bought
on
the
cheap
will
soon
be
producing
profits
,
thus
restoring
the
market
's
faith
in
them
.

Hence
the
LBO
craze
.

But
here
is
where
the
entrepreneur
made
a
very
risky
bet
,
and
where
society
was
maybe
foolish
to
look
the
other
way
.

The
profit
rate
is
still
low
and
the
Q
ratio
was
only
65
%
in
1987
and
68.9
%
in
1988
.

Result
:
a
landscape
littered
with
lemons
,
huge
debt
burdens
crushing
down
upon
the
arch
and
spans
of
corporate
America
.

The
mounting
risks
did
not
go
unobserved
,
even
in
the
mid-1980s
.

But
there
were
enough
promoters
announcing
the
end
of
history
(
in
this
case
suspension
of
normal
laws
of
economic
gravity
)
for
society
to
continue
shielding
its
eyes
.

Mainstream
economists
and
commentators
,
craning
their
necks
up
at
the
great
pyramids
of
junk
financing
,
swiveling
their
heads
to
watch
the
avalanche
of
leveraged
buy-outs
,
claimed
the
end
result
would
be
a
leaner
,
meaner
corporate
America
,
with
soaring
productivity
and
profits
and
the
weaker
gone
to
the
wall
.

But
this
is
not
where
the
rewards
of
junk
financing
were
found
.

The
beneficiaries
were
those
financiers
whose
icon
was
the
topic
figure
of
'80s
capitalism
,
Michael
Milken
's
$
517
million
salary
in
one
year
.

Left-stream
economists
I
associate
with
--
fellows
in
the
Union
of
Radical
Political
Economists
,
most
particularly
Robert
Pollin
of
the
economics
faculty
at
the
University
of
California
at
Riverside
--
were
not
hypnotized
in
the
manner
of
their
pliant
colleagues
.

All
along
they
have
been
noting
the
tremors
and
pointing
out
the
underlying
realities
.

Profit
rates
after
the
great
merger
wave
are
no
higher
,
and
now
we
have
an
extremely
high-interest
burden
relative
to
cash
flow
.

The
consequences
of
building
empires
with
sand
are
showing
up
.

In
contrast
to
previous
estimates
reckoning
the
default
rate
on
junk
bonds
at
2
%
or
3
%
,
a
Harvard
study
published
in
April
of
this
year
(
and
discussed
in
a
lead
story
in
The
Wall
Street
Journal
for
Sept.
18
)
found
the
default
rate
on
these
junk
bonds
is
34
%
.

What
is
the
consequence
of
a
high-interest
burden
,
high
default
rates
and
continued
low
profitability
?

Corporations
need
liquidity
,
in
the
form
of
borrowed
funds
.

Without
liquidity
from
the
junk-bond
market
or
cash
flow
from
profits
,
they
look
to
the
government
,
which
obediently
assists
the
natural
motions
of
the
capitalist
economy
with
charity
in
the
form
of
cuts
in
the
capital-gains
tax
rate
or
bailouts
.

The
consequence
can
be
inflation
,
brought
on
as
the
effect
of
a
desperate
bid
to
avoid
the
deflationary
shock
of
a
sudden
crash
.

Attacks
on
inflation
come
with
another
strategy
of
capital
of
a
very
traditional
sort
:
an
assault
on
wages
.

Mr.
Fukuyama
,
peering
through
binoculars
at
the
end
of
history
,
said
in
his
essay
that
``
the
class
issue
has
actually
been
successfully
resolved
in
the
West
...

the
egalitarianism
of
modern
America
represents
the
essential
achievement
of
the
classless
society
envisioned
by
Marx
.
''

Mr.
Fukuyama
might
want
to
consult
some
American
workers
on
the
subject
of
class
and
egalitarianism
.

From
its
peak
in
1972
of
$
198.41
,
the
average
American
weekly
wage
had
fallen
to
$
169.28
in
1987
--
both
figures
being
expressed
in
1977
dollars
.

In
other
words
,
after
the
glory
boom
of
the
Reagan
years
,
wages
had
sunk
from
the
post
World
War
II
peak
by
16
%
as
capitalists
,
helped
by
the
government
,
turned
down
the
screws
or
went
offshore
.

But
there
are
signs
now
--
the
strikes
by
miners
,
Boeing
workers
,
telephone
workers
,
etc.
--
that
this
attack
on
wages
is
being
more
fiercely
resisted
.

These
are
long-term
Richter
readings
on
American
capitalism
.

The
whole
structure
is
extremely
shaky
.

Governments
have
become
sophisticated
in
handling
moments
of
panic
(
a
word
the
London
Times
forbade
my
father
to
use
when
he
was
reporting
the
Wall
Street
crash
in
1929
)
.

But
sophistication
has
its
limits
.

The
S&L
bailout
could
cost
$
300
billion
,
computing
interest
on
the
government
's
loans
.

These
are
real
costs
.

Under
what
weights
will
the
Federal
Deposit
Insurance
Corporation
totter
?

Capitalism
may
now
be
engineered
to
withstand
sudden
shocks
,
but
there
are
fault
lines
--
the
crisis
in
profits
,
the
assault
on
wages
,
the
structural
inequity
of
the
system
--
that
make
fools
of
those
who
claim
that
the
future
is
here
and
that
history
is
over
.

Mr.
Cockburn
is
a
columnist
for
The
Nation
and
LA
Weekly
.

Japan
Air
Lines
,
Lufthansa
German
Airlines
and
Air
France
reportedly
plan
to
form
an
international
air-freight
company
this
year
,
a
move
that
could
further
consolidate
the
industry
.

Japanese
newspaper
Nihon
Keizai
Shimbun
reported
that
the
three
giants
plan
to
integrate
their
cargo
computers
and
ground-cargo
and
air-cargo
systems
.

They
reportedly
will
invest
a
total
of
20
billion
yen
(
$
140
million
)
in
the
venture
,
whose
headquarters
would
be
in
France
or
West
Germany
.

The
action
follows
Federal
Express
Corp.
's
acquisition
of
Flying
Tiger
Line
Inc.
in
August
.

After
that
,
``
it
would
make
sense
for
airlines
to
talk
about
doing
things
jointly
,
''
said
Cotton
Daly
,
director
of
cargo
services
for
New
York
consulting
firm
Simat
,
Helliesen
&
Eichner
Inc
.

Mr.
Daly
said
such
discussions
are
motivated
by
the
competitive
threat
posed
by
Federal
Express
,
United
Parcel
Service
of
America
Inc.
and
other
fast-growing
air-freight
companies
.

Many
airlines
are
talking
about
cargo
ventures
,
and
there
have
been
rumors
about
such
a
tie
between
JAL
and
European
airlines
.

In
Tokyo
,
a
JAL
spokesman
said
he
could
n't
confirm
or
deny
the
latest
Japanese
report
.

But
he
said
JAL
is
talking
to
Lufthansa
and
Air
France
about
some
sort
of
cargo
venture
.

``
It
is
just
one
of
a
number
of
strategies
JAL
has
embarked
upon
to
come
to
terms
with
the
situation
in
Europe
after
1992
,
''
the
deadline
for
ending
trade
barriers
in
the
EC
,
he
said
.

In
Frankfurt
,
a
Lufthansa
spokesman
confirmed
talks
are
under
way
,
but
declined
to
comment
.

A
Lufthansa
spokeswoman
in
Tokyo
said
the
head
of
Lufthansa
's
cargo
operations
had
been
in
Toyko
last
week
for
talks
with
JAL
.

In
Paris
,
Air
France
declined
to
comment
.

``
Nothing
is
defined
or
signed
at
this
point
,
''
Mr.
Daly
said
of
the
talks
.

Whatever
accord
the
three
carriers
reach
,
he
said
,
he
is
skeptical
it
would
create
a
separate
airline
.

If
the
three
companies
pool
their
air-freight
businesses
,
their
clout
would
be
considerable
.

According
to
figures
from
the
International
Air
Transport
Association
,
they
carried
a
combined
1.8
million
tons
of
freight
last
year
.

Federal
Express
and
Flying
Tiger
,
as
separate
companies
,
carried
a
combined
2.6
million
tons
.

Air
France
and
Lufthansa
last
month
concluded
a
far-reaching
cooperation
accord
that
includes
air-freight
activities
.

They
plan
to
increase
cooperation
in
freight
ground-handling
and
create
a
world-wide
computer
system
to
process
cargo
.

Other
airlines
would
have
access
to
the
system
,
they
said
,
and
negotiations
with
partners
were
already
under
way
.

Both
European
airlines
operate
extensive
fleets
of
Boeing
747
freighters
and
747
Combis
,
aircraft
that
carry
both
freight
and
passengers
on
the
main
deck
.

They
currently
have
large
orders
for
cargo
planes
.

Several
airlines
,
including
Lufthansa
,
JAL
and
Cathay
Pacific
Airways
,
are
working
on
a
so-called
global
cargo
system
and
are
trying
to
attract
other
carriers
to
join
,
Mr.
Daly
said
.

JAL
also
has
signaled
it
is
looking
for
toeholds
in
Europe
before
the
end
of
1992
.

Last
month
,
the
carrier
said
it
wanted
to
lease
crews
and
planes
from
British
Airways
so
it
could
funnel
its
passengers
from
London
to
other
European
destinations
.

British
Airways
said
it
has
n't
received
a
proposal
from
JAL
.

But
last
week
there
were
air-traffic
negotiations
between
the
U.K.
and
Japan
,
a
likely
first
step
to
any
commercial
agreement
between
JAL
and
British
Airways
or
another
U.K.
carrier
.

Federal
Paper
Board
Co.
said
it
completed
the
previously
announced
purchase
of
Imperial
Cup
Corp.
,
a
closely
held
maker
of
paper
cups
based
in
Kenton
,
Ohio
.

Terms
were
n't
disclosed
.

Imperial
Cup
has
annual
sales
of
approximately
$
75
million

In
a
move
to
prevent
any
dislocation
in
the
financial
markets
from
the
California
earthquake
,
the
Securities
and
Exchange
Commission
said
it
temporarily
reassigned
options
listed
on
the
Pacific
Stock
Exchange
to
the
American
,
New
York
and
Philadelphia
stock
exchanges
and
to
the
Chicago
Board
Options
Exchange
.

The
decision
,
which
affects
millions
of
dollars
of
trading
positions
,
was
made
late
yesterday
because
the
Pacific
exchange
's
options
floor
was
shut
down
as
a
result
of
Tuesday
's
earthquake
.

The
SEC
,
faced
with
a
major
squeeze
on
options
positions
,
said
it
was
necessary
to
ensure
that
options
listed
on
the
exchange
could
be
traded
today
and
tomorrow
.

SEC
Chairman
Richard
Breeden
said
the
cooperation
by
the
exchanges
would
enable
investors
to
buy
and
sell
options
listed
solely
on
the
Pacific
exchange
,
guaranteeing
the
liquidity
of
the
market
.

Officials
at
the
four
exchanges
said
well
over
50
traders
from
the
Pacific
exchange
were
taking
flights
from
San
Francisco
late
yesterday
to
the
American
,
New
York
and
Philadelphia
exchanges
and
to
the
CBOE
,
where
they
would
continue
making
markets
in
the
Pacific-listed
options
.

The
Big
Board
said
carpenters
quickly
erected
a
new
options
floor
to
accomodate
40
traders
from
the
Pacific
exchange
.

In
addition
,
specialists
on
the
exchanges
agreed
to
provide
backup
capital
for
market-making
in
Pacific
exchange
options
traded
on
the
exchanges
.

Trading
was
light
on
the
Pacific
Stock
Exchange
yesterday
,
with
workers
at
the
exchange
's
main
floor
in
San
Francisco
struggling
to
execute
orders
by
flashlight
as
a
result
of
a
continuing
power
outage
.

The
most
pressing
problem
was
the
suspension
of
options
trading
.

The
Pacific
exchange
has
options
for
129
underlying
stock
issues
,
including
highly
active
Hilton
Hotels
Corp.
,
which
is
listed
on
the
Big
Board
.

Investors
were
concerned
that
they
might
be
unable
to
exercise
options
that
expire
tomorrow
.

But
professionals
said
throughout
the
day
that
the
shutdown
would
n't
be
a
cause
for
alarm
even
if
it
were
to
persist
for
several
days
.

``
I
've
told
my
staff
and
clients
that
they
still
have
the
ability
to
exercise
their
options
,
because
they
are
guaranteed
by
the
Options
Clearing
Corp.
,
''
said
Michael
Schwartz
,
a
senior
registered
options
strategist
at
Oppenheimer
&
Co
.

The
SEC
reassigned
trading
in
the
options
,
however
,
to
allow
investors
to
do
more
than
simply
exercise
the
options
.

While
the
exchange
's
equities
floor
in
San
Francisco
remained
open
on
a
limited
basis
,
orders
were
being
routed
and
executed
in
Los
Angeles
.

Workers
could
dial
out
,
but
they
could
n't
receive
telephone
calls
.

``
It
's
a
very
uncertain
situation
right
now
,
''
said
Navin
Vyas
,
administrative
assistant
of
trading
floor
operations
of
the
exchange
,
which
has
daily
volume
of
about
10
million
shares
.

Because
the
exchange
's
computer
was
rerouting
orders
to
the
exchange
's
trading
operations
in
Los
Angeles
,
``
business
is
as
usual
''
Mr.
Vyas
said
.

``
If
one
city
is
down
,
the
other
can
take
over
.
''

Meanwhile
,
the
brokerage
firms
in
San
Francisco
were
trying
to
cope
.

Charles
Daggs
,
chairman
and
chief
executive
officer
of
Sutro
&
Co.
,
said
traders
came
to
work
at
5
a.m.
PDT
--
many
on
foot
because
of
uncertain
road
and
traffic
conditions
--
but
learned
that
they
would
have
to
await
a
required
inspection
by
the
city
in
order
to
turn
the
power
back
on
at
the
company
's
two
main
facilities
there
.

That
should
happen
by
today
,
he
said
.

Traders
worked
with
the
help
of
sunlight
streaming
through
windows
,
despite
large
cracks
in
the
walls
and
a
lack
of
incoming
phone
calls
.

Also
,
most
of
the
telecommunications
equipment
was
out
.

The
traders
were
executing
municipal
bond
,
mutual
fund
and
other
orders
through
a
sister
firm
,
Tucker
Anthony
Inc.
,
which
is
also
owned
by
John
Hancock
Freedom
Securities
but
is
based
in
New
York
.

``
We
are
having
a
regular
day
.

Volume
is
down
out
of
San
Francisco
,
but
not
out
of
the
11
outlying
offices
,
''
Mr.
Daggs
added
.

Sutro
's
Oakland
office
executed
orders
through
the
Sacramento
office
,
which
was
n't
affected
by
the
quake
.

Others
,
like
Prudential-Bache
Securities
Inc.
,
which
has
eight
offices
in
the
San
Francisco
area
,
set
up
an
800
number
yesterday
morning
for
customers
to
obtain
market
commentary
and
other
help
.

At
Kidder
,
Peabody
&
Co.
's
Sacramento
branch
,
Manager
Janet
White
received
calls
yesterday
morning
from
workers
in
San
Francisco
who
offered
to
work
in
Sacramento
.

Then
she
discovered
that
Quotron
Systems
Inc.
's
Sacramento
lines
were
down
,
because
they
are
normally
tied
in
through
a
system
that
goes
through
San
Francisco
.

So
the
Kidder
brokers
had
to
call
other
company
offices
to
get
quotes
on
stocks
.

At
Quotron
,
the
company
's
National
Call-In
Center
,
which
swung
into
action
for
the
first
time
last
month
for
Hurricane
Hugo
,
assembled
a
tactical
team
at
5
a.m.
yesterday
to
begin
rerouting
lines
and
restore
service
to
brokers
and
traders
.

The
company
dispatched
as
many
as
200
people
in
the
San
Francisco
area
to
do
the
work
,
though
most
of
the
rerouting
was
done
by
computer
.

Service
appeared
to
be
down
throughout
the
financial
district
in
downtown
San
Francisco
,
while
just
parts
of
Oakland
and
San
Jose
were
knocked
out
.

But
Dale
Irvine
,
director
of
the
emergency
center
,
said
service
was
being
restored
to
outlying
San
Francisco
areas
.

In
Chicago
yesterday
,
Options
Clearing
confirmed
that
it
guarantees
the
Pacific
exchange
options
.

The
firm
also
will
permit
its
members
and
the
public
``
to
exercise
their
put
and
call
options
contracts
traded
on
the
Pacific
exchange
''
even
if
the
exchange
is
closed
,
said
Wayne
Luthringshausen
,
chairman
of
Options
Clearing
.

(

at

.

Investors
and
traders
in
Pacific
exchange
options
``
are
protected
to
the
extent
that
they
can
convert
their
put
and
call

''
Mr.
Luthringshausen
said
.

``
We
are
seeing
such
exercises
today
,
in
fact
.

International
Business
Machines
Corp.
said
its
board
approved
the
purchase
of
$
1
billion
of
its
common
shares
,
a
move
that
should
help
support
its
battered
stock
.

Even
as
the
stock
market
has
generally
done
well
this
year
,
IBM
's
shares
have
slipped
steadily
from
its
52-week
high
of
$
130.875
.

Yesterday
's
closing
price
of
$
101.75
,
down
50
cents
,
in
composite
trading
on
the
New
York
Stock
Exchange
,
puts
the
stock
at
about
1
1\/2
times
book
value
,
which
is
as
low
as
it
has
sunk
over
the
past
decade
.

The
announcement
came
after
the
market
's
close
.

The
move
by
IBM
was
n't
exactly
a
surprise
.

The
company
has
spent
some
$
5
billion
over
the
past
3
1\/2
years
to
buy
back
42
million
common
shares
,
or
roughly
7
%
of
those
outstanding
.

In
addition
,
despite
IBM
's
well-publicized
recent
problems
,
the
computer
giant
still
generates
enormous
amounts
of
cash
.

As
of
the
end
of
the
second
quarter
,
it
had
$
4.47
billion
of
cash
and
marketable
securities
on
hand
.

As
a
result
,
some
securities
analysts
had
predicted
in
recent
days
that
IBM
would
authorize
additional
purchases
.

In
Armonk
,
N.Y.
,
a
spokesman
said
that
although
IBM
did
n't
view
its
spending
as
necessarily
a
way
to
support
the
stock
,
it
thought
the
purchases
were
a
good
way
to
improve
such
financial
measurements
as
per-share
earnings
and
return
on
equity
.

``
We
view
it
as
a
good
long-term
investment
,
''
the
spokesman
said
.

In
the
short
term
,
the
move
is
likely
to
have
little
effect
.

At
yesterday
's
closing
price
,
$
1
billion
would
buy
back
about
10
million
shares
,
or
less
than
2
%
of
the
roughly
580
million
outstanding
.

In
addition
,
as
of
Sept.
30
,
the
company
still
had
authorization
to
buy
$
368
million
of
stock
under
a
prior
repurchase
program
.

Over
the
long
term
,
however
,
IBM
's
stock
repurchases
--
along
with
its
hefty
,
$
4.84-a-share
annual
dividend
and
generally
loyal
following
among
large
institutional
investors
--
are
providing
a
floor
for
the
stock
price
.

Although
IBM
last
year
produced
its
first
strong
results
in
four
years
and
was
expected
to
continue
to
roll
this
year
,
it
began
faltering
as
early
as
January
.

First
,
it
had
trouble
manufacturing
a
chip
for
its
mainframes
,
IBM
's
bread-and-butter
business
.

Then
it
had
a
series
of
smaller
glitches
,
including
problems
manufacturing
certain
personal
computers
and
the
delay
in
the
announcement
of
some
important
workstations
.

Finally
,
IBM
had
to
delay
the
introduction
of
some
high-end
disk
drives
,
which
account
for
10
%
of
its
$
60
billion
of
annual
revenue
.

None
of
the
problems
is
necessarily
fatal
,
and
they
are
n't
all
necessarily
even
related
.

There
are
also
other
factors
at
work
that
are
outside
IBM
's
control
,
such
as
currency
exchange
rates
.

The
strong
dollar
,
which
reduces
the
value
of
overseas
earnings
and
revenue
when
they
are
translated
into
dollars
,
is
expected
to
knock
80
to
85
cents
off
IBM
's
per-share
earnings
for
the
full
year
.

Without
that
problem
,
IBM
might
have
matched
last
year
's
earnings
of
$
5.81
billion
,
or
$
9.80
a
share
.

Still
,
investors
will
take
some
convincing
before
they
get
back
into
IBM
's
stock
in
a
big
way
.

Steve
Milunovich
,
a
securities
analyst
at
First
Boston
,
said
that
while
investors
were
looking
for
an
excuse
to
buy
IBM
shares
a
year
ago
,
even
the
big
institutional
investors
are
looking
for
a
reason
to
avoid
the
stock
these
days
.

On
Wall
Street
yesterday
,
northern
California
's
killer
earthquake
was
just
another
chance
to
make
a
buck
.

At
the
opening
bell
,
investors
quickly
began
singling
out
shares
of
companies
expected
to
profit
or
suffer
in
some
way
from
the
California
disaster
,
including
insurers
,
construction-related
companies
,
refiners
and
housing
lenders
.

Brokerage
houses
jumped
in
,
touting
``
post-quake
demand
''
stocks
,
and
Kidder
,
Peabody
&
Co.
set
up
a
toll-free
hot
line
for
San
Franciscans
who
might
need
emergency
investment
advice
and
help
in
transferring
funds
.

``
Wall
Street
thinks
of
everything
in
terms
of
money
,
''
says
Tom
Gallagher
,
a
senior
Oppenheimer
&
Co.
trader
.

However
,
he
added
,
such
event-driven
trading
moves
typically
last
only
a
few
hours
and
are
often
made
without
full
information
.

The
most
popular
plays
of
the
day
were
insurance
companies
such
as
General
Re
Corp.
,
which
rose
$
2.75
to
$
86.50
,
Nac
Re
Corp.
,
up
$
2
to
$
37.75
,
American
International
Group
Inc.
,
up
$
3.25
to
$
102.625
,
and
Cigna
Corp.
,
up
87.5
cents
to
$
62.50
.

Yesterday
,
the
brokerage
firm
Conning
&
Co.
said
insurers
will
use
the
earthquake
as
an
excuse
to
raise
insurance
rates
,
ending
their
long
price
wars
.

Before
this
bullish
theory
surfaced
,
some
insurance
stocks
initially
fell
,
indicating
that
investors
thought
the
quake
might
cost
insurers
a
lot
of
money
.

In
fact
,
Fireman
's
Fund
Corp.
,
which
ended
the
day
off
50
cents
to
$
36.50
,
said
earthquake
damage
would
slightly
hurt
fourth-quarter
profit
.

On
the
prospect
for
rebuilding
northern
California
,
investors
bid
up
cement-makers
Calmat
Co.
,
up
$
2.75
to
$
28.75
,
and
Lone
Star
Industries
Inc.
,
up
$
1.75
to
$
29.25
.

Bridge
and
road
builders
had
a
field
day
,
including
Kasler
Corp.
,
up
$
2.125
to
$
9.875
,
Guy
F.
Atkinson
Co.
,
up
87.5
to
$
61.875
,
and
Morrison
Knudsen
Corp.
,
which
reported
higher
third-quarter
earnings
yesterday
,
up
$
2.25
to
$
44.125
.

Fluor
Corp.
,
a
construction
engineering
firm
,
gained
75
cents
to
$
33.375
.

But
home-building
stocks
were
a
mixed
bag
.

Timber
stocks
got
a
big
boost
.

Georgia
Pacific
Corp.
,
up
$
1.25
to
$
58
,
and
Maxxam
Inc.
,
up
$
3
to
$
43.75
,
both
reported
strong
profits
.

Merrill
Lynch
&
Co.
touted
Georgia-Pacific
,
Louisiana
Pacific
Corp.
and
Willamette
Industries
Inc.
as
the
best
post-quake
plywood
plays
.

Other
gainers
were
companies
with
one
or
more
undamaged
California
refineries
.

Tosco
Corp.
jumped
$
1.125
to
$
20.125
and
Chevron
Corp.
,
despite
a
temporary
pipeline
shutdown
,
rose
$
1
to
$
65
.

Meanwhile
,
shares
of
some
big
housing
lenders
got
hit
,
on
the
likelihood
that
the
lenders
'
collateral
--
people
's
homes
--
suffered
physical
damage
and
perhaps
a
loss
in
value
.

Wells
Fargo
&
Co.
fell
50
cents
to
$
81.50
,
and
BankAmerica
Corp.
fell
50
cents
to
$
31.875
.

Some
California
thrift
stocks
also
fell
,
including
Golden
West
Financial
Corp.
and
H.F.
Ahmanson
&
Co.
,
which
reported
lower
earnings
yesterday
.

``
Property
values
did
n't
go
up
in
California
yesterday
,
''
says
one
money
manager
.

Pacific
Gas
&
Electric
Co.
fell
37.5
cents
to
$
19.625
.

One
of
its
power
generators
was
damaged
,
though
the
company
said
there
wo
n't
be
any
financial
impact
.

Pacific
Telesis
Group
lost
62.5
cents
to
$
44.625
.

A
computer
failure
delayed
its
earnings
announcement
,
and
some
investors
think
it
might
have
extra
costs
to
repair
damaged
telephone
lines
.

Heavy
construction
,
property-casualty
insurance
and
forest
products
were
among
the
best
performing
industry
groups
in
the
Dow
Jones
Equity
Market
Index
yesterday
.

Friday
's
stock
market
plunge
claimed
its
second
victim
among
the
scores
of
futures
and
options
trading
firms
here
.

Petco
Options
,
an
options
trading
firm
owned
by
the
family
of
the
deceased
former
Chicago
Board
of
Trade
chairman
Ralph
Peters
,
is
getting
out
of
the
trade
clearing
,
or
processing
and
guaranteeing
,
business
after
sustaining
a
multimillion
dollar
loss
Friday
,
options
industry
officials
said
.

Nearly
75
options
traders
on
the
Chicago
Board
Options
Exchange
who
cleared
trades
through
Petco
,
including
a
handful
of
traders
who
lost
between
$
500,000
to
$
1
million
themselves
as
a
result
of
Friday
's
debacle
,
are
trying
to
transfer
their
business
to
other
clearing
firms
,
CBOE
members
said
.

Timothy
Vincent
,
Petco
chief
executive
officer
,
confirmed
that
Petco
was
withdrawing
from
the
clearing
business
.

``
The
owners
of
the
company
got
a
look
at
the
potential
risks
in
this
business
,
and
after
Monday
they
felt
they
did
n't
want
to
be
exposed
any
more
,
''
he
said
.

He
added
that
Petco
remained
in
compliance
with
all
industry
capital
requirements
during
the
market
's
rapid
plunge
Friday
and
Monday
's
rebound
.

A
CBOE
spokeswoman
declined
comment
on
Petco
.

Over
the
weekend
Fossett
Corp.
,
another
options
trading
firm
,
transferred
the
clearing
accounts
of
about
160
traders
to
First
Options
of
Chicago
,
a
unit
of
Continental
Bank
Corp.
,
because
it
could
n't
meet
regulatory
capital
requirements
after
Friday
's
market
slide
.

The
unprecedented
transfer
of
accounts
underscored
the
options
industry
's
desire
not
to
have
its
credibility
tarnished
by
potentially
widespread
trading
defaults
on
Monday
.

The
CBOE
,
American
Stock
Exchange
,
Options
Clearing
Corp.
and
Stephen
Fossett
,
owner
of
Fossett
,
joined
in
putting
up
$
50
million
to
guarantee
the
accounts
at
First
Options
.

The
head
of
another
small
options
clearing
firm
,
who
asked
not
to
be
identified
,
said
that
the
heightened
volatility
in
the
financial
markets
in
recent
years
makes
it
increasingly
difficult
for
any
but
the
largest
financial
trading
firms
to
shoulder
the
risk
inherent
in
the
highly
leveraged
options
and
futures
business
.

Prior
to
the
introduction
of
financial
futures
in
the
late
1970s
,
most
trading
firms
clustered
around
the
LaSalle
Street
financial
district
here
were
family
operations
handed
down
from
one
generation
to
the
next
.

Most
also
were
relatively
undercapitalized
compared
with
the
size
of
most
Wall
Street
securities
firms
.

Mr.
Peters
,
a
LaSalle
Street
legend
among
the
post-World
War
II
generation
of
commodity
traders
,
was
rumored
to
have
amassed
a
multimillion-dollar
fortune
from
commodity
trading
and
other
activities
by
the
time
he
died
in
May
.

Part
of
a
Series
}

Betty
Lombardi
is
a
mild-mannered
homemaker
and
grandmother
in
rural
Hunterdon
County
,
N.J
.

But
put
her
behind
a
shopping
cart
and
she
turns
ruthless
.

If
Colgate
toothpaste
offers
a
tempting
money-saving
coupon
,
she
'll
cross
Crest
off
her
shopping
list
without
a
second
thought
.

Never
mind
that
her
husband
prefers
Crest
.

Some
weeks
when
her
supermarket
runs
a
double-coupon
promotion
,
she
boasts
that
she
shaves
$
22
off
her
bill
.

Money
is
n't
the
only
thing
that
makes
her
dump
once
favorite
brands
.

After
she
heard
about
the
artery-clogging
hazards
of
tropical
oils
in
many
cookies
,
she
dropped
Pepperidge
Farm
and
started
buying
brands
free
of
such
oils
.

``
I
always
thought
Pepperidge
Farm
was
tasty
and
high
quality
,
''
Mrs.
Lombardi
says
.

``
But
I
do
n't
want
any
of
that
oil
for
my
grandkids
.
''

(
Pepperidge
Farm
says
it
ca
n't
tell
exactly
how
many
customers
it
has
lost
,
but
it
hopes
to
remove
the
objectionable
tropical
oil
from
all
its
products
by
year
end
.
)

Clearly
,
people
like
Mrs.
Lombardi
are
giving
marketers
fits
.

She
represents
a
new
breed
of
savvy
consumer
who
puts
bargain
prices
,
nutritional
and
environmental
concerns
,
and
other
priorities
ahead
of
old-fashioned
brand
loyalty
.

While
brand
loyalty
is
far
from
dead
,
marketing
experts
say
it
has
eroded
during
the
1980s
.

Marketers
themselves
are
partly
to
blame
:
They
've
increased
spending
for
coupons
and
other
short-term
promotions
at
the
expense
of
image-building
advertising
.

What
's
more
,
a
flood
of
new
products
has
given
consumers
a
dizzying
choice
of
brands
,
many
of
which
are
virtually
carbon
copies
of
one
other
.

``
Marketers
have
brought
this
on
themselves
with
their
heavy
use
''
of
promotions
,
contends
Joe
Plummer
,
an
executive
vice
president
at
the
D'Arcy
Masius
Benton
&
Bowles
ad
agency
.

``
Without
some
real
product
improvements
,
it
's
going
to
be
difficult
to
win
that
loyalty
back
.
''

The
Wall
Street
Journal
's
``
American
Way
of
Buying
''
survey
this
year
found
that
most
consumers
switch
brands
for
many
of
the
products
they
use
.

For
the
survey
,
Peter
D.
Hart
Research
Associates
asked
some
2,000
consumers
,
including
Mrs.
Lombardi
,
whether
they
usually
buy
one
brand
of
a
certain
type
of
product
or
have
no
brand
loyalty
.

More
than
half
the
users
of
17
of
the
25
products
included
in
the
survey
said
they
're
brand
switchers
.

Overall
,
12
%
of
consumers
are
n't
brand
loyal
for
any
of
the
25
product
categories
.

About
47
%
are
loyal
for
one
to
five
of
the
products
.

Only
2
%
are
brand
loyal
in
16
to
20
of
the
categories
,
and
no
one
is
loyal
for
more
than
20
types
of
products
.

For
such
products
as
canned
vegetables
and
athletic
shoes
,
devotion
to
a
single
brand
was
quite
low
,
with
fewer
than
30
%
saying
they
usually
buy
the
same
brand
.

Only
for
cigarettes
,
mayonnaise
and
toothpaste
did
more
than
60
%
of
users
say
they
typically
stick
with
the
same
brand
.

People
tend
to
be
most
loyal
to
brands
that
have
distinctive
flavors
,
such
as
cigarettes
and
ketchup
.

Kathie
Huff
,
a
respondent
in
the
Journal
survey
from
Spokane
,
Wash.
,
says
her
husband
is
adamant
about
eating
only
Hunt
's
ketchup
.

He
simply
ca
n't
stomach
the
taste
of
Heinz
,
she
says
.

The
31-year-old
homemaker
adds
,
``
The
only
other
thing
I
'm
really
loyal
to
is
my
Virginia
Slims
cigarettes
.

Coke
and
Pepsi
are
all
the
same
to
me
,
and
I
usually
buy
whichever
brand
of
coffee
happens
to
be
on
sale
.
''

Brand
imagery
plays
a
significant
role
in
loyalty
to
such
products
as
cigarettes
,
perfume
and
beer
.

People
often
stay
with
a
particular
brand
because
they
want
to
be
associated
with
the
image
its
advertising
conveys
,
whether
that
's
macho
Marlboro
cigarettes
or
Cher
's
Uninhibited
perfume
.

Loyalty
lags
most
for
utilitarian
products
like
trash
bags
and
batteries
.

Only
23
%
of
trash-bag
users
in
the
Journal
survey
usually
buy
the
same
brand
,
and
just
29
%
of
battery
buyers
stick
to
one
brand
.

Underwear
scored
a
middling
36
%
in
brand
loyalty
,
but
consumer
researchers
say
that
's
actually
quite
high
for
such
a
mundane
product
.

``
In
the
past
,
you
just
wore
Fruit
of
the
Loom
and
did
n't
care
,
''
says
Peter
Kim
,
U.S.
director
of
consumer
behavior
research
for
the
J.
Walter
Thompson
ad
agency
.

``
The
high
score
reflects
the
attempts
to
make
underwear
more
of
a
fashion
image
business
for
both
men
and
women
.
''

He
believes
there
's
opportunity
for
a
smart
gasoline
marketer
to
create
a
strong
brand
image
and
more
consumer
loyalty
.

What
loyalty
there
is
to
gas
brands
,
he
believes
,
is
a
matter
of
stopping
at
the
most
conveniently
located
service
stations
.

Brand
loyalty
was
stronger
among
older
consumers
in
the
Journal
survey
.

Nearly
one-fourth
of
participants
age
60
and
older
claim
brand
loyalty
for
more
than
10
of
the
25
products
in
the
survey
;
only
9
%
of
those
age
18
to
29
have
such
strong
allegiance
.

Higher-income
people
also
tend
to
be
more
brand
loyal
these
days
,
the
Journal
survey
and
other
research
studies
indicate
.

Marketers
speculate
that
more
affluent
people
tend
to
lead
more
pressured
lives
and
do
n't
have
time
to
research
the
products
they
buy
for
the
highest
quality
and
most
reasonable
price
.

An
established
brand
name
is
insurance
that
at
least
the
product
will
be
of
acceptable
quality
,
if
not
always
the
best
value
for
the
money
.

It
's
sort
of
loyalty
by
default
.

Meanwhile
,
``
the
bottom
end
of
the
market
is
becoming
less
loyal
,
''
says
Laurel
Cutler
,
vice
chairman
of
the
ad
agency
FCB\/Leber
Katz
Partners
.

``
They
're
buying
whatever
's
cheaper
.
''

The
biggest
wild
card
in
the
brand
loyalty
game
:
How
those
hotly
pursued
but
highly
unpredictable
baby
boomers
will
behave
as
they
move
into
middle
age
.

They
grew
up
with
more
brand
choices
than
any
generation
and
have
shown
less
allegiance
so
far
.

But
now
that
they
're
settling
down
and
raising
families
,
might
they
also
show
more
stability
in
their
brand
choices
?

Mr.
Kim
of
J.
Walter
Thompson
does
n't
think
so
.

He
believes
baby
boomers
will
continue
to
be
selective
in
their
brand
loyalties
.

``
Earlier
generations
were
brand
loyal
across
categories
,
''
he
says
,
``
but
boomers
tend
to
be
brand
loyal
in
categories
like
running
shoes
and
bottled
water
,
but
less
so
in
others
like
toilet
paper
and
appliances
.
''

While
not
as
brand
loyal
as
in
the
past
,
consumers
today
do
n't
buy
products
capriciously
,
either
.

Rather
,
they
tend
to
have
a
set
of
two
or
three
favorites
.

Sometimes
,
they
'll
choose
Ragu
spaghetti
sauce
;
other
times
,
it
will
be
Prego
.

Advertisers
attribute
this
shared
loyalty
to
the
striking
similarity
among
brands
.

If
a
more
absorbent
Pampers
hits
the
market
,
you
can
be
sure
a
new
and
improved
Huggies
wo
n't
be
far
behind
.

The
BBDO
Worldwide
ad
agency
studied
``
brand
parity
''
and
found
that
consumers
believe
all
brands
are
about
the
same
in
a
number
of
categories
,
particularly
credit
cards
,
paper
towels
,
dry
soups
and
snack
chips
.

``
When
there
's
a
clutter
of
brands
,
consumers
simplify
the
complexity
by
telling
themselves
,
`
All
brands
are
the
same
so
what
difference
does
it
make
which
I
buy
,
'
''
says
Karen
Olshan
,
a
senior
vice
president
at
BBDO
.

``
Too
often
,
advertising
imagery
has
n't
done
a
good
job
of
forging
a
special
emotional
bond
between
a
brand
and
the
consumer
.
''

But
given
such
strong
brand
disloyalty
,
some
marketers
are
putting
renewed
emphasis
on
image
advertising
.

A
small
but
growing
number
of
companies
are
also
trying
to
instill
more
fervent
brand
loyalty
through
such
personalized
direct-marketing
ploys
as
catalogs
,
magazines
and
membership
clubs
for
brand
users
.

While
discount
promotions
are
essential
for
most
brands
,
some
companies
concede
they
went
overboard
in
shifting
money
from
advertising
to
coupons
,
refunds
and
other
sales
incentives
.

Some
people
argue
that
strong
brands
can
afford
to
stop
advertising
for
a
time
because
of
the
residual
impact
of
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
spent
on
advertising
through
the
years
.

But
most
companies
are
too
afraid
to
take
that
chance
.

And
perhaps
with
good
reason
.

Says
Clayt
Wilhite
,
president
of
the
D'Arcy
Masius
ad
agency
's
U.S.
division
,
``
Every
time
24
hours
pass
without
any
advertising
reinforcement
,
brand
loyalty
will
diminish
ever
so
slightly
--
even
for
a
powerful
brand
like
Budweiser
.
''

Consider
,
for
example
,
what
happened
to
Maxwell
House
coffee
.

The
Kraft
General
Foods
brand
stopped
advertising
for
about
a
year
in
1987
and
gave
up
several
market
share
points
and
its
leadership
position
in
the
coffee
business
.

But
since
returning
to
advertising
,
Maxwell
House
has
regained
the
lost
share
and
is
running
neck
and
neck
with
archrival
Folgers
.

``
Now
,
Philip
Morris
{
Kraft
General
Foods
'
parent
company
}
is
committed
to
the
coffee
business
and
to
increased
advertising
for
Maxwell
House
,
''
says
Dick
Mayer
,
president
of
the
General
Foods
USA
division
.

``
Even
though
brand
loyalty
is
rather
strong
for
coffee
,
we
need
advertising
to
maintain
and
strengthen
it
.
''

Campbell
Soup
Co.
,
for
one
,
has
concluded
that
it
makes
good
sense
to
focus
more
on
its
most
loyal
customers
than
on
people
who
buy
competitive
brands
.

``
The
probability
of
converting
a
non-user
to
your
brand
is
about
three
in
1,000
,
''
says
Tony
Adams
,
the
company
's
vice
president
for
marketing
research
.

``
The
best
odds
are
with
your
core
franchise
.

Our
heavy
users
consume
two
to
three
cans
of
soup
a
week
,
and
we
'd
like
to
increase
that
.
''

So
Campbell
is
talking
to
its
``
brand
enthusiasts
,
''
probing
their
psychological
attachment
to
its
soup
.

In
one
consumer
focus
group
,
a
fan
declared
that
,
``
Campbell
's
soup
is
like
getting
a
hug
from
a
friend
.
''

That
helped
persuade
the
company
to
introduce
a
new
advertising
slogan
:
``
A
warm
hug
from
Campbell
's
.
''

Insurers
face
the
prospect
of
paying
out
billions
of
dollars
for
damages
caused
by
this
week
's
California
earthquake
.

Getting
a
grip
on
the
extent
of
the
damages
is
proving
a
far
more
difficult
task
than
what
insurers
faced
after
Hurricane
Hugo
ripped
through
the
Caribbean
and
the
Carolinas
last
month
.

The
earthquake
's
toll
,
including
possible
deep
structural
damage
,
goes
far
beyond
the
more
easily
observed
damage
from
a
hurricane
,
says
George
Reider
,
a
vice
president
in
Aetna
Life
&
Casualty
Insurance
Co.
's
claims
division
.

But
investors
are
betting
that
the
financial
and
psychological
impact
of
the
earthquake
,
coming
so
soon
after
the
hurricane
,
will
help
stem
more
than
two
years
of
intense
price-cutting
wars
among
business
insurers
.

Reflecting
that
logic
,
insurance-company
stocks
posted
strong
gains
.

Aetna
and
other
insurers
are
hiring
engineers
and
architects
to
help
them
assess
structural
damage
.

Most
insurers
already
have
mobilized
their
``
catastrophe
''
teams
to
begin
processing
claims
from
their
policyholders
in
northern
California
.

Since
commercial
air
travel
is
interrupted
,
Aetna
,
based
in
Hartford
,
Conn.
,
chartered
three
planes
to
fly
claims
adjusters
into
Sacramento
and
then
planned
for
them
to
drive
to
the
Bay
area
.

About
25
adjusters
were
dispatched
yesterday
afternoon
,
along
with
laptop
computers
,
cellular
phones
and
blank
checks
.

Some
adjusters
,
already
in
other
parts
of
California
,
drove
to
the
disaster
area
with
recreational
vehicles
and
mobile
homes
that
could
be
used
as
makeshift
claims-processing
centers
.

Insurers
will
be
advertising
800
numbers
--
probably
on
the
radio
--
that
policyholders
can
call
to
get
assistance
on
how
to
submit
claims
.

State
Farm
Mutual
Automobile
Insurance
Co.
,
the
largest
home
and
auto
insurer
in
California
,
believes
the
losses
from
the
earthquake
could
be
somewhat
less
than
the
$
475
million
in
damages
it
expects
to
pay
out
for
claims
resulting
from
Hurricane
Hugo
.

State
Farm
,
based
in
Bloomington
,
Ind.
,
is
also
the
largest
writer
of
personal-property
earthquake
insurance
in
California
.

Earthquake
insurance
is
sold
as
a
separate
policy
or
a
specific
endorsement
``
rider
''
on
a
homeowner
's
policy
in
California
,
because
of
the
area
's
vulnerability
to
earthquakes
.

State
Farm
said
about
25
%
of
its
policyholders
in
California
have
also
purchased
earthquake
insurance
.

Allstate
Insurance
Co.
,
a
unit
of
Sears
,
Roebuck
&
Co.
,
said
about
23
%
of
its
personal
property
policyholders
--
about
28
%
in
the
San
Franciso
area
--
also
have
earthquake
coverage
.

The
Association
of
California
Insurance
Companies
estimated
damage
to
residential
property
could
total
$
500
million
,
but
only
$
100
million
to
$
150
million
is
insured
,
it
said
.

Officials
from
the
American
Insurance
Association
's
property-claim
service
division
,
which
coordinates
the
efforts
of
the
claims
adjusters
in
an
area
after
a
natural
disaster
,
will
be
flying
to
San
Francisco
today
.

They
expect
to
have
a
preliminary
estimate
of
the
damages
in
a
day
or
two
.

Roads
and
bridges
in
the
Bay
area
appear
to
have
suffered
some
of
the
most
costly
damage
.

Highways
,
such
as
the
section
of
Interstate
880
that
collapsed
in
Oakland
,
generally
do
n't
have
insurance
coverage
.

Industry
officials
say
the
Bay
Bridge
--
unlike
some
bridges
--
has
no
earthquake
coverage
,
either
,
so
the
cost
of
repairing
it
probably
would
have
to
be
paid
out
of
state
general
operating
funds
.

However
,
the
bridge
,
which
charges
a
$
1
toll
each
way
,
does
have
``
loss
of
income
''
insurance
to
replace
lost
revenue
if
the
operation
of
the
bridge
is
interrupted
for
more
than
seven
days
.

That
coverage
is
provided
by
a
syndicate
of
insurance
companies
including
Fireman
's
Fund
Corp.
,
based
in
Novato
,
Calif.
,
and
Cigna
Corp.
,
based
in
Philadelphia
.

Earthquake-related
claims
are
n't
expected
to
cause
significant
financial
problems
for
the
insurance
industry
as
a
whole
.

Instead
,
even
with
the
liabilities
of
two
natural
disasters
in
recent
weeks
,
analysts
said
the
total
capital
of
the
industry
is
likely
to
be
higher
at
year
end
than
it
was
at
midyear
.

Indeed
,
the
earthquake
could
contribute
to
a
turnaround
in
the
insurance
cycle
in
a
couple
of
ways
.

For
example
,
insurers
may
seek
to
limit
their
future
exposure
to
catastrophes
by
increasing
the
amount
of
reinsurance
they
buy
.

Such
increased
demand
for
reinsurance
,
along
with
the
losses
the
reinsurers
will
bear
from
these
two
disasters
,
are
likely
to
spur
increases
in
reinsurance
prices
that
will
later
be
translated
into
an
overall
price
rise
.

Reinsurance
is
protection
taken
out
by
the
insurance
firms
themselves
.

``
We
are
saying
this
is
the
breaking
point
,
this
is
the
event
that
will
change
the
psychology
of
the
marketplace
,
''
said
William
Yankus
,
an
analyst
with
Conning
&
Co.
,
a
Hartford
firm
that
specializes
in
the
insurance
industry
.

His
firm
,
along
with
some
others
,
issued
new
buy
recommendations
on
insurer
stocks
yesterday
.

Among
the
insurance
stocks
,
big
gainers
included
American
International
Group
,
up
$
3.25
to
$
102.625
;
General
Re
Corp.
,
up
$
2.75
to
$
86.50
;
Aetna
,
up
$
2.375
to
$
59.50
;
and
Marsh
&
McLennan
Inc.
,
up
$
3.125
to
$
75.875
.

Still
,
a
few
individual
companies
,
most
likely
smaller
ones
,
could
be
devastated
.

``
I
think
there
is
a
damned
good
chance
someone
is
going
to
hit
the
skids
on
this
,
''
said
Oppenheimer
&
Co.
analyst
Myron
Picoult
.

He
suspects
some
insurers
who
had
purchased
reinsurance
to
limit
their
exposure
to
catastrophes
will
discover
that
reinsurance
was
used
up
by
Hurricane
Hugo
.

British
,
West
German
,
Scandinavian
and
other
overseas
insurers
are
bracing
for
big
claims
from
the
San
Francisco
earthquake
disaster
.

Although
it
's
unclear
how
much
exposure
the
London
market
will
face
,
U.K.
underwriters
traditionally
have
a
large
reinsurance
exposure
to
U.S.
catastrophe
coverage
.

Jack
Byrne
,
chairman
of
Fireman
's
Fund
,
said
this
disaster
will
test
the
catastrophe
reinsurance
market
,
causing
these
rates
to
soar
.

The
catastrophe
losses
sustained
by
insurers
this
year
will
probably
be
the
worst
on
an
inflation-adjusted
basis
since
1906
--
when
another
earthquake
sparked
the
Great
San
Francisco
Fire
.

Orin
Kramer
,
an
insurance
consultant
in
New
York
,
estimates
that
the
1906
San
Francisco
destruction
,
on
an
inflation-adjusted
basis
,
included
insured
losses
of
$
5.8
billion
.

He
is
estimating
this
week
's
disaster
will
generate
insured
losses
of
$
2
billion
to
$
4
billion
,
following
about
$
4
billion
in
costs
to
insurers
from
Hurricane
Hugo
.

Silicon
Graphics
Inc.
's
first-quarter
profit
rose
sharply
to
$
5.2
million
,
or
28
cents
a
share
,
from
$
1
million
,
or
six
cents
a
share
,
a
year
ago
.

The
maker
of
computer
workstations
said
a
surge
of
government
orders
contributed
to
the
increase
.

Revenue
rose
95
%
to
$
86.4
million
from
$
44.3
million
the
year
earlier
.

In
national
over-the-counter
trading
,
the
company
closed
yesterday
at
$
23.25
a
share
,
down
25
cents
.

Hunter
Environmental
Services
Inc.
said
it
reached
a
preliminary
accord
on
the
sale
of
its
environmental
consulting
and
services
business
for
about
$
40
million
and
assumption
of
related
debt
.

The
buyer
was
n't
identified
.

The
company
said
it
also
is
making
progress
in
negotiating
the
buy-out
of
its
design
division
by
management
.

In
addition
,
Hunter
said
it
will
use
proceeds
from
a
private
placement
of
$
8
million
of
preferred
shares
to
purchase
an
interest
in
a
start-up
company
to
underwrite
environmental
impairment
insurance
.

Hunter
wants
to
concentrate
its
resources
on
the
insurance
business
and
on
a
project
to
store
hazardous
wastes
in
salt
domes
.

Jaguar
PLC
's
chairman
said
he
hopes
to
reach
a
friendly
pact
with
General
Motors
Corp.
within
a
month
that
may
involve
the
British
luxury-car
maker
's
producing
a
cheaper
executive
model
.

Sir
John
Egan
told
reporters
at
London
's
Motorfair
yesterday
he
``
would
be
disappointed
if
we
could
n't
do
{
the
deal
}
within
a
month
.
''

He
said
the
tie-up
would
mean
Jaguar
could
``
develop
cars
down
range
{
in
price
}
from
where
we
are
''
by
offering
access
to
GM
's
high-volume
parts
production
.

Besides
creating
joint
manufacturing
ventures
,
the
accord
is
expected
to
give
GM
about
a
15
%
stake
that
eventually
would
rise
to
about
30
%
.

Jaguar
figures
a
friendly
alliance
with
GM
will
fend
off
unwelcome
advances
from
Ford
Motor
Co
.

But
Ford
,
Jaguar
's
biggest
shareholder
since
lifting
its
stake
to
10.4
%
this
week
,
is
pressing
harder
for
talks
with
Sir
John
.

``
We
're
getting
to
the
point
where
we
are
going
to
have
to
meet
''
with
him
,
one
Ford
official
said
yesterday
.

Ford
probably
will
renew
its
request
for
such
a
meeting
soon
,
he
added
.

Sir
John
has
spurned
Ford
's
advances
since
the
U.S.
auto
giant
launched
a
surprise
bid
for
as
much
as
15
%
of
Jaguar
last
month
.

Ford
has
signaled
it
might
acquire
a
majority
interest
later
.

``
I
'm
not
obligated
to
sit
down
and
talk
to
anybody
,
''
the
Jaguar
chairman
asserted
yesterday
.

He
did
n't
rule
out
negotiations
with
Ford
,
however
.

The
fiercely
proud
but
financially
strapped
British
company
prefers
to
remain
independent
and
publicly
held
,
despite
Ford
's
promise
of
access
to
cash
and
technological
know-how
.

Sir
John
noted
that
GM
,
a
longtime
Jaguar
supplier
,
agrees
``
we
should
remain
an
independent
company
.
''

He
said
Jaguar
started
negotiating
with
GM
and
several
other
car
makers
over
a
year
ago
,
but
the
rest
``
dropped
by
the
wayside
ever
since
the
share
price
went
above
#
4
(
$
6.30
)
a
share
.
''

Jaguar
shares
stood
at
405
pence
before
Ford
's
initial
announcement
,
but
the
subsequent
takeover
frenzy
has
driven
them
up
.

The
stock
traded
late
yesterday
on
London
's
stock
exchange
at
673
pence
,
up
19
pence
.

Developing
an
executive-model
range
would
mark
a
major
departure
for
Britain
's
leading
luxury-car
maker
.

A
typical
British
executive
car
is
mass
produced
and
smaller
than
a
luxury
car
.

It
generally
fetches
no
more
than
#
25,000
(
$
39,400
)
--
roughly
#
16,000
less
than
the
highest-priced
Jaguars
,
which
are
all
known
for
their
hand-crafted
leather
work
.

``
We
have
designs
for
such
{
executive
}
cars
,
but
have
never
been
able
to
develop
them
,
''
Sir
John
said
.

GM
's
help
would
``
make
it
possible
{
for
Jaguar
}
to
build
a
wider
range
of
cars
.
''

An
executive
model
would
significantly
boost
Jaguar
's
yearly
output
of
50,000
cars
.

``
You
are
talking
about
a
couple
hundred
thousand
a
year
,
''
said
Bob
Barber
,
an
auto-industry
analyst
at
U.K.
brokerage
James
Capel
&
Co
.

A
pact
with
GM
may
emerge
in
as
little
as
two
weeks
,
according
to
sources
close
to
the
talks
.

The
deal
would
require
approval
by
a
majority
of
Jaguar
shareholders
.

``
We
have
to
make
it
attractive
enough
that
{
holders
}
would
accept
it
,
''
Sir
John
said
.

That
may
be
difficult
,
the
Jaguar
chairman
acknowledged
,
``
when
you
have
somebody
else
breathing
down
your
neck
.

''
Ford
probably
would
try
to
kill
the
proposal
by
enlisting
support
from
U.S.
takeover-stock
speculators
and
holding
out
the
carrot
of
a
larger
bid
later
,
said
Stephen
Reitman
,
European
auto
analyst
at
London
brokers
UBS
Phillips
&
Drew
.

Ford
ca
n't
make
a
full-fledged
bid
for
Jaguar
until
U.K.
government
restrictions
expire
.

The
anti-takeover
measure
prevents
any
outside
investor
from
buying
more
than
15
%
of
Jaguar
shares
without
permission
until
Dec.
31
,
1990
.

But
with
its
10.4
%
stake
,
Ford
can
convene
a
special
Jaguar
shareholders
'
meeting
and
urge
them
to
drop
the
restrictions
prematurely
.

``
It
's
a
very
valuable
weapon
in
their
armory
,
''
which
could
enable
Ford
to
bid
sooner
for
Jaguar
,
observed
Mr.
Barber
of
James
Capel
.

Otherwise
,
Jaguar
may
have
to
tolerate
the
two
U.S.
auto
giants
each
owning
a
15
%
stake
for
more
than
a
year
.

``
It
would
be
difficult
to
see
how
a
car
company
can
be
owned
by
a
collective
,
''
Sir
John
said
.

``
It
has
never
been
done
before
,
but
there
's
always
a
first
.

Although
two
Baby
Bells
showed
strong
growth
in
access
lines
,
usage
and
unregulated
business
revenue
,
one
reported
a
modest
gain
in
third-quarter
net
while
the
other
posted
a
small
drop
.

Ameritech
Corp.
's
earnings
increased
2.8
%
,
after
strong
revenue
gains
were
offset
somewhat
by
refunds
and
rate
reductions
imposed
by
regulators
in
its
Midwest
territory
.

BellSouth
Corp.
's
third-quarter
earnings
dropped
3.8
%
as
a
result
of
debt
refinancing
,
the
recent
acquisition
of
a
cellular
and
paging
property
and
rate
reductions
in
its
Southeast
territory
.

BellSouth

At
BellSouth
,
based
in
Atlanta
,
customer
access
lines
grew
by
162,000
,
or
3.5
%
,
during
the
12-month
period
ended
Sept
.

For
the
third
quarter
,
total
operating
revenue
grew
2.6
%
to
$
3.55
billion
from
$
3.46
billion
.

Total
operating
expenses
increased
3.5
%
to
$
2.78
billion
from
$
2.69
billion
.

Overall
access
minutes
of
use
increased
10.3
%
and
toll
messages
jumped
5.2
%
.

BellSouth
Chairman
and
Chief
Executive
Officer
John
L.
Clendenin
said
three
factors
accounted
for
the
drop
in
third-quarter
earnings
.

The
refinancing
of
$
481
million
in
long-term
debt
reduced
net
income
by
$
22
million
,
or
five
cents
a
share
,
but
in
the
long
run
will
save
more
than
$
250
million
in
interest
costs
.

The
company
previously
said
that
the
recent
acquisition
of
Mobile
Communications
Corp.
of
America
would
dilute
1989
earnings
by
about
3
%
.

In
addition
,
earnings
were
reduced
by
rate
reductions
in
Florida
,
Kentucky
,
Alabama
,
Tennessee
and
Louisiana
.

Ameritech

At
Ameritech
,
based
in
Chicago
,
customer
access
lines
increased
by
402,000
,
or
2.6
%
,
and
cellular
mobile
lines
increased
by
80,000
,
or
62.3
%
,
for
the
12-month
period
ended
Sept.
30
.

For
the
third
quarter
,
revenue
increased
1.9
%
to
$
2.55
billion
from
$
2.51
billion
.

Operating
expenses
increased
2.6
%
to
$
2.04
billion
,
including
one-time
pretax
charges
of
$
40
million
for
labor
contract
signing
bonuses
.

Local
service
revenue
increased
3.5
%
and
directory
and
unregulated
business
revenue
jumped
9.5
%
.

But
network
access
revenue
dropped
4
%
and
toll

dropped
1.4

The
Wall
Street
Journal
``
American
Way
of
Buying
''
Survey
consists
of
two
separate
,
door-to-door
nationwide
polls
conducted
for
the
Journal
by
Peter
D.
Hart
Research
Associates
and
the
Roper
Organization
.

The
two
surveys
,
which
asked
different
questions
,
were
conducted
using
national
random
probability
samples
.

The
poll
conducted
by
Peter
D.
Hart
Research
Associates
interviewed
2,064
adults
age
18
and
older
from
June
15
to
June
30
,
1989
.

The
poll
conducted
by
the
Roper
Organization
interviewed
2,002
adults
age
18
and
older
from
July
7
to
July
15
,
1989
.

Responses
were
weighted
on
the
basis
of
age
and
gender
to
conform
with
U.S.
Census
data
.

For
each
poll
,
the
odds
are
19
out
of
20
that
if
pollsters
had
sought
to
survey
every
household
in
the
U.S.
using
the
same
questionnaire
,
the
findings
would
differ
from
these
poll
results
by
no
more
than
2
1\/2
percentage
points
in
either
direction
.

The
margin
of
error
for
subgroups
--
for
example
,
married
women
with
children
at
home
--
would
be
larger
.

In
addition
,
in
any
survey
,
there
is
always
the
chance
that
other
factors
such
as
question
wording
could
introduce
errors
into
the
findings
.

Program
traders
were
buying
and
selling
at
full
steam
Monday
,
the
first
trading
session
after
the
stock
market
's
190.58-point
plunge
Friday
.

They
accounted
for
a
hefty
16
%
of
New
York
Stock
Exchange
volume
Monday
,
the
fourth
busiest
session
ever
.

On
Friday
,
13
%
of
volume
was
in
computer-guided
program
trades
.

In
August
,
by
contrast
,
program
trading
averaged
10.3
%
of
daily
Big
Board
turnover
.

Program
traders
were
publicly
castigated
following
the
508-point
crash
Oct.
19
,
1987
,
and
a
number
of
brokerage
firms
pulled
back
from
using
this
strategy
for
a
while
.

But
as
the
outcry
faded
by
the
spring
of
1988
,
they
resumed
.

Some
observers
thought
that
after
Friday
's
sharp
drop
,
the
firms
would
rein
in
their
program
traders
to
avoid
stoking
more
controversy
.

But
the
statistics
released
yesterday
show
the
firms
did
nothing
of
the
sort
.

One
reason
,
they
said
,
was
that
the
official
reports
on
the
1987
crash
exonerated
program
trading
as
a
cause
.

Stock-index
arbitrage
is
the
most
controversial
form
of
program
trading
because
it
accelerates
market
moves
,
if
not
actually
causing
them
.

In
it
,
traders
buy
or
sell
stocks
and
offset
those
positions
in
stock-index
futures
contracts
to
profit
from
fleeting
price
discrepancies
.

Under
the
exchange
's
definitions
,
program
trading
also
describes
a
number
of
other
strategies
that
,
in
the
opinion
of
some
traders
,
do
n't
cause
big
swings
in
the
market
.

The
Big
Board
's
disclosure
of
program
trading
activity
on
these
two
days
was
unusual
.

Though
it
collects
such
data
daily
,
its
monthly
reports
on
program
trading
usually
come
out
about
three
weeks
after
each
month
ends
.

The
September
figures
are
due
to
be
released
this
week
.

The
Big
Board
declined
to
name
the
Wall
Street
firms
involved
in
the
activity
Friday
and
Monday
,
or
the
type
of
strategies
used
.

But
traders
on
the
exchange
floor
,
who
can
observe
the
computer-guided
trading
activity
on
monitor
screens
,
said
most
of
the
top
program-trading
firms
were
active
both
days
.

Through
August
,
the
top
five
program
trading
firms
in
volume
were
Morgan
Stanley
&
Co.
,
Kidder
,
Peabody
&
Co.
,
Merrill
Lynch
&
Co.
,
PaineWebber
Group
Inc.
and
Salomon
Brothers
Inc
.

Though
brokerage
officials
defended
their
use
of
program
trading
,
one
sign
of
what
an
issue
it
remains
was
that
few
executives
would
comment
on
the
record
.

Besides
reciting
the
pardon
for
program
trading
contained
in
the
Brady
Commission
report
,
they
said
stock-index
arbitrage
was
actually
needed
Monday
to
restore
the
markets
'
equilibrium
.

On
Friday
,
the
stock-index
futures
market
was
unhinged
from
the
stock
market
when
the
Chicago
Mercantile
Exchange
halted
trading
in
Standard
&
Poor
's
500
futures
contract
--
a
``
circuit
breaker
''
procedure
instituted
after
the
1987
crash
and
implemented
for
the
first
time
.

Futures
trading
resumed
a
half-hour
later
,
but
the
session
ended
shortly
thereafter
,
leaving
the
stock
market
set
up
for
more
sell
programs
,
traders
said
.

By
Monday
morning
,
they
said
,
stock-index
arbitrage
sell
programs
helped
re-establish
the
link
between
stocks
and
futures
.

But
stunning
volatility
was
produced
in
the
process
.

The
Dow
Jones
Industrial
Average
plunged
a
breathtaking
63.52
points
in
the
first
40
minutes
of
trading
Monday
as
stock-index
arbitrage
sell
programs
kicked
in
.

At
about
10:10
a.m.
EDT
,
the
market
abruptly
turned
upward
on
stock-index
arbitrage
buy
programs
.

By
day
's
end
,
the
Dow
industrials
had
rebounded
88.12
points
,
or
nearly
half
of
Friday
's
drop
.

FREDERICK

Valley
National
Corp.
reported
a
third-quarter
net
loss
of
$
72.2
million
,
or
$
3.65
a

,
and
suspended
its
quarterly
dividend
because
of
potential
losses
on
its
Arizona
real

holdings
.

The
Phoenix-based
holding
company
for

bank
said
it
added

to
its

million
,
or
$
2.46
a
share
,
in
the
1988
period
.

Valley
National
had
been
paying
a
quarterly
dividend
of
36
cents
a
share
.

``
The
Arizona
real
estate
market
continues
to
be
depressed
,
and
there
is
still
uncertainty
as
to
when
values
will
recover
,
''
James
P.
Simmons
,
chairman
,
said
.

The
decision
to
increase
the
loan-loss
reserve
and
suspend
the
dividend
is
``
both
prudent
and
in
the
best
long-term
interest
of
the
shareholders
,
''
he
said
.

Valley
National
said
it
made
the
decision
on
the
basis
of
an
``
overall
assessment
of
the
marketplace
''
and
the
condition
of
its
loan
portfolio
and
after
reviewing
it
with
federal
regulators
.

The
addition
to
reserves
comes
on
top
of
a
provision
of
$
199.7
million
that
was
announced
in
June
.

In
July
,
Moody
's
downgraded
$
400
million
of
the
company
's
debt
,
saying
the
bank
holding
company
had
n't
taken
adequate
write-offs
against
potential
losses
on
real
estate
loans
despite
its
second-quarter
write-down
.

Richard
M.
Greenwood
,
Valley
National
's
executive
vice
president
,
said
then
that
the
company
believed
the
write-downs
were
``
adequate
''
and
did
n't
plan
to
increase
its
reserves
again
.

Bruce
Hoyt
,
a
banking
analyst
with
Boettcher
&
Co.
,
a
Denver
brokerage
firm
,
said
Valley
National
``
is
n't
out
of
the
woods
yet
.
''

The
key
will
be
whether
Arizona
real
estate
turns
around
or
at
least
stabilizes
,
he
said
.

``
They
've
stepped
up
to
the
plate
to
take
the
write-downs
,
but
when
markets
head
down
,
a
company
is
always
exposed
to
further
negative
surprises
,
''
Mr.
Hoyt
said
.

Valley
National
closed
yesterday
at
$
24.25
a
share
,
down
$
1
,
in
national
over-the-counter
trading
.

Two
years
of
coddling
,
down
the
drain
.

That
's
the
way
a
lot
of
brokers
feel
today
on
the
second
anniversary
of
the
1987
stock-market
crash
.

Ever
since
that
fearful
Black
Monday
,
they
've
been
tirelessly
wooing
wary
individual
investors
--
trying
to
convince
them
that
Oct.
19
,
1987
,
was
a
fluke
and
that
the
stock
market
really
is
a
safe
place
for
average
Americans
to
put
their
hard-earned
dollars
.

And
until
last
Friday
,
it
seemed
those
efforts
were
starting
to
pay
off
.

``
Some
of
those
folks
were
coming
back
,
''
says
Leslie
Quick
Jr.
,
chairman
,
of
discount
brokers
Quick
&
Reilly
Group
Inc
.

``
We
had
heard
from
people
who
had
n't
been
active
''
for
a
long
time
.

Then
came
the
frightening
190-point
plunge
in
the
Dow
Jones
Industrial
Average
and
a
new
wave
of
stock-market
volatility
.

All
of
a
sudden
,
it
was
back
to
square
one
.

``
It
's
going
to
set
things
back
for
a
period
,
because
it
reinforces
the
concern
of
volatility
,
''
says
Jeffrey
B.
Lane
,
president
of
Shearson
Lehman
Hutton
Inc
.

``
I
think
it
will
shake
confidence
one
more
time
,
and
a
lot
of
this
business
is
based
on
client
confidence
.
''

Brokers
around
the
country
say
the
reaction
from
individual
investors
this
week
has
been
almost
eerie
.

Customers
and
potential
customers
are
suddenly
complaining
about
the
stock
market
in
the
exact
way
they
did
in
post-crash
1987
.

``
The
kinds
of
questions
you
had
before
have
resurfaced
,
''
says
Raymond
A.
``
Chip
''
Mason
,
chairman
of
regional
brokerage
firm
Legg
Mason
Inc.
,
Baltimore
.

``
I
can
just
tell
the
questions
are
right
back
where
they
were
:
`
What
's
going
on
?
,
'
`
Ca
n't
anything
be
done
about
program
trading
?
,
'
`
Does
n't
the
exchange
understand
?
,
'
`
Where
is
the
SEC
on
this
?
'
''

Mr.
Mason
says
he
's
convinced
the
public
still
wants
to
invest
in
common
stocks
,
even
though
they
believe
the
deck
is
stacked
against
them
.

But
``
these
wide
swings
scare
them
to
death
.
''

All
of
this
is
bad
news
for
the
big
brokerage
firms
such
as
Shearson
and
Merrill
Lynch
&
Co.
that
have
big
``
retail
,
''
or
individual-investor
,
businesses
.

After
expanding
rapidly
during
the
bull-market
years
up
to
the
1987
crash
,
retail
brokerage
operations
these
days
are
getting
barely
enough
business
to
pay
the
overhead
.

True
,
the
amount
of
money
investors
are
willing
to
entrust
to
their
brokers
has
been
growing
lately
.

But
those
dollars
have
been
going
into
such
``
safe
''
products
as
money
market
funds
,
which
do
n't
generate
much
in
the
way
of
commissions
for
the
brokerage
firms
.

At
discount
brokerage
Charles
Schwab
&
Co.
,
such
``
cash-equivalent
''
investments
recently
accounted
for
a
record
$
8
billion
of
the
firm
's
$
25
billion
of
client
's
assets
.

The
brokers
'
hope
has
been
that
they
could
soon
coax
investors
into
shifting
some
of
their
hoard
into
the
stock
market
.

And
before
last
Friday
,
they
were
actually
making
modest
progress
.

A
slightly
higher
percentage
of
New
York
Stock
Exchange
volume
has
been
attributed
to
retail
investors
in
recent
months
compared
with
post-crash
1988
,
according
to
Securities
Industry
Association
data
.

In
1987
,
an
average
19.7
%
of
Big
Board
volume
was
retail
business
,
with
the
monthly
level
never
more
than
21.4
%
.

The
retail
participation
dropped
to
an
average
18.2
%
in
1988
,
and
shriveled
to
barely
14
%
some
months
during
the
year
.

Yet
in
1989
,
retail
participation
has
been
more
than
20
%
in
every
month
,
and
was
23.5
%
in
August
,
the
latest
month
for
which
figures
are
available
.

Jeffrey
Schaefer
,
the
SIA
's
research
director
,
says
that
all
of
his
group
's
retail-volume
statistics
could
be
overstated
by
as
much
as
five
percentage
points
because
corporate
buy-backs
are
sometimes
inadvertently
included
in
Big
Board
data
.

But
there
did
seem
to
be
a
retail
activity
pickup
.

But
``
Friday
did
n't
help
things
,
''
says
Mr.
Schaefer
.

With
the
gyrations
of
recent
days
,
says
Hugo
Quackenbush
,
senior
vice
president
at
Charles
Schwab
,
many
small
investors
are
absolutely
convinced
that
``
they
should
n't
play
in
the
stock
market
.
''

Joseph
Grano
,
president
of
retail
sales
and
marketing
at
PaineWebber
Group
Inc.
,
still
thinks
that
individual
investors
will
eventually
go
back
into
the
stock
market
.

Investors
will
develop
``
thicker
skins
,
''
and
their
confidence
will
return
,
he
says
.

Friday
's
plunge
,
he
is
telling
PaineWebber
brokers
,
was
nothing
more
than
a
``
tremendous
reaction
to
leveraged
buy-out
stocks
.
''

Meanwhile
,
PaineWebber
remains
among
the
leaders
in
efforts
to
simply
persuade
investors
to
keep
giving
Wall
Street
their
money
.

``
It
's
more
of
an
important
issue
to
keep
control
of
those
assets
,
rather
than
push
the
investor
to
move
into
(
specific
)
products
such
as
equities
,
''
Mr.
Grano
says
.

``
The
equity
decision
will
come
when
the
client
is
ready
and
when
there
's
a
semblance
of
confidence
.
''

It
could
be
a
long
wait
,
say
some
industry
observers
.

``
Some
investors
will
tiptoe
back
in
,
''
says
Richard
Ross
,
a
market
research
director
for
Elrick
&
Lavidge
in
Chicago
.

``
Then
there
'll
be
another
swing
.

Given
enough
of
these
,
this
will
drive
everyone
out
except
the
most
hardy
,
''
he
adds
.

Mr.
Ross
,
who
has
been
studying
retail
investors
'
perception
of
risks
in
the
brokerage
industry
,
said
a
market
plunge
like
Friday
's
``
shatters
investors
'
confidence
in
their
ability
to
make
any
judgments
on
the
market
.
''

The
long-term
outlook
for
the
retail
brokerage
business
is
``
miserable
,
''
Mr.
Ross
declares
.

John

and
companies
he
touted
in
a
newsletter
.

In
1986
,
in
another
consent
agreement
with
the
SEC
,
Mr.
Holmes
was
enjoined
from
violating
the
stock-registration
and
anti-fraud
provisions
of
the
securities
laws
.

Without
any
admission
or
denial
of
guilt
by
Mr.
Holmes
,
that
agreement
settled
SEC
charges
that
Mr.
Holmes
sold
unregistered
securities
and
misled
investors
.

In
charges
filed
last
week
in
federal
district
court
in
Charlotte
,
N.C.
,
the
SEC
alleged
that
Venture
Capitalists
Inc.
,
Venture
Finance
Corp.
and
New
Ventures
Fund
Inc.
,
all
of
Charlotte
,
failed
repeatedly
to
file
proper
documents
.

The
SEC
also
charged
that
Mr.
Holmes
acted
as
an
officer
or
director
of
New
Ventures
,
in
violation
of
his
previous
consent
agreement
.

``
Some
companies
were
delinquent
in
filings
and
other
actions
,
all
of
which
cost
money
,
''
Mr.
Holmes
said
.

Two
of
Mr.
Holmes
's
business
associates
who
worked
for
Venture
Capitalists
,
Kimberly
Ann
Smith
and
Frederick
Byrum
,
also
consented
to
being
enjoined
from
violations
of
registration
provisions
of
the
securities
laws
.

Ms.
Smith
also
agreed
to
a
permanent
injunction
barring
her
from
acting
as
an
officer
,
director
or
investment
adviser
of
any
mutual
fund
,
unit
investment
trust
or
face-amount
certificate
company
.

Mr.
Byrum
and
Ms.
Smith
could
n't
be
reached
for
comment
.

In
consenting
to
the
injunctions
,
none
of
the
individuals
or
companies
admitted
or
denied
the
allegations
.

Senate
Republicans
have
settled
on
a
proposal
that
would
cut
the
capital-gains
tax
for
individuals
and
corporations
.

At
the
same
time
,
a
small
group
of
Senate
Democrats
are
working
on
a
similar
plan
and
may
introduce
it
soon
.

Sen.
Bob
Packwood
(
R.
,
Ore.
)
,
the
lead
sponsor
of
the
GOP
proposal
,
said
he
intends
to
unveil
the
plan
today
and
to
offer
it
as
an
amendment
to
whatever
legislation
comes
along
,
particularly
this
month
's
bill
to
raise
the
federal
borrowing
limit
.

He
gave
10-to-1
odds
that
a
capital-gains
tax
cut
of
some
sort
would
be
approved
this
year
,
though
it
probably
wo
n't
be
included
in
the
pending
deficit-reduction
bill
.

He
added
that
he
expects
to
talk
to
the
Democrats
who
also
wanted
to
cut
the
gains
tax
about
drafting
a
joint
proposal
.

For
individuals
,
the
Packwood
plan
would
exclude
from
income
5
%
of
the
gain
from
the
sale
of
a
capital
asset
held
for
more
than
one
year
.

The
exclusion
would
rise
five
percentage
points
for
each
year
the
asset
was
held
until
it
reached
a
maximum
of
35
%
.

The
exclusion
would
apply
to
assets
sold
after
Oct.
1
,
1989
.

As
an
alternative
,
he
said
,
taxpayers
could
chose
to
reduce
their
gains
by
an
inflation
index
.

For
corporations
,
the
top
tax
rate
on
the
sale
of
assets
held
for
more
than
three
years
would
be
cut
to
33
%
from
the
current
top
rate
of
34
%
.

That
rate
would
gradually
decline
to
as
little
as
29
%
for
corporate
assets
held
for
15
years
.

The
Packwood
plan
would
also
include
a
proposal
,
designed
by
Sen.
William
Roth
(
R.
,
Del.
)
,
that
would
expand
and
alter
the
deduction
for
individual
retirement
accounts
.

The
Roth
plan
would
create
a
new
,
non-deductible
IRA
from
which
money
could
be
withdrawn
tax-free
not
only
for
retirement
,
but
also
for
the
purchase
of
a
first
home
and
to
pay
education
and
medical
expenses
.

Current
IRAs
could
be
rolled
over
into
the
new
IRAs
but
would
be
subject
to
tax
.

For
their
part
,
the
group
of
Democrats
are
working
on
a
plan
that
,
like
the
Packwood
proposal
,
would
grant
larger
exclusions
to
assets
the
longer
they
were
held
by
individuals
and
companies
.

Newly
acquired
assets
would
get
a
bigger
break
than
those
currently
held
.

An
extra
exclusion
would
be
given
to
long-held
stock
in
small
and
medium-size
corporations
just
starting
up
.

No
one
in
the
Senate
is
considering
the
capital-gains
plan
passed
by
the
House
.

That
plan
would
provide
a
30
%
exclusion
to
assets
sold
over
a
2
1\/2-year
period
ending
Dec.
31
,
1991
.

After
then
,
the
House
measure
would
boost
the
tax
rate
to
28
%
and
exclude
from
tax
the
gain
attributable
to
inflation
.

Senators
are
focusing
on
making
a
capital-gains
differential
permanent
.

Separately
,
Chairman
Dan
Rostenkowski
(
D.
,
Ill
.
)
of
the
House
Ways
and
Means
Committee
said
he
did
n't
want
the
capital-gains
tax
cut
or
any
other
amendments
attached
to
the
pending
bill
raising
the
federal
borrowing
limit
.

The
current
debt
limit
expires
Oct.
31
.

He
also
urged
House
and
Senate
negotiators
to
rid
the
deficit-reduction
bill
of
all
provisions
that
increase
the
budget
deficit
,
including
the
House-passed
capital-gains
provision
.

From
a
helicopter
a
thousand
feet
above
Oakland
after
the
second-deadliest
earthquake
in
U.S.
history
,
a
scene
of
devastation
emerges
:
a
freeway
crumbled
into
a
concrete
sandwich
,
hoses
pumping
water
into
once-fashionable
apartments
,
abandoned
autos
.

But
this
quake
was
n't
the
big
one
,
the
replay
of
1906
that
has
been
feared
for
so
many
years
.

Despite
the
tragic
loss
of
more
than
270
lives
,
and
damage
estimated
in
the
billions
,
most
businesses
and
their
plants
and
offices
in
the
Bay
area
were
n't
greatly
affected
.

The
economic
life
of
the
region
is
expected
to
revive
in
a
day
or
two
,
although
some
transportation
problems
may
last
weeks
or
months
.

A
main
factor
mitigating
more
widespread
damage
was
the
location
of
the
quake
's
epicenter
--
20
miles
from
the
heart
of
the
Silicon
Valley
and
more
than
50
miles
from
downtown
San
Francisco
and
Oakland
.

Also
,
the
region
's
insistence
on
strict
building
codes
helped
prevent
wider
damage
.

The
tremendous
energy
of
the
quake
was
dissipated
by
the
distance
,
so
that
most
parts
of
the
valley
and
the
major
cities
suffered
largely
cosmetic
damage
--
broken
windows
,
falling
brick
and
cornices
,
buckled
asphalt
or
sidewalks
.

Of
course
,
the
quake
was
the
worst
since
the
emergence
of
the
computer
era
turned
Silicon
Valley
into
the
nation
's
capital
of
high
technology
.

Like
other
major
American
cities
,
the
San
Francisco
--
Oakland
area
owes
its
current
prosperity
more
to
its
infrastructure
of
fiber-optic
cables
linking
thousands
of
computer
terminals
and
telephones
than
to
its
location
astride
one
of
the
world
's
great
natural
harbors
.

When
the
tremors
struck
,
the
region
's
largely
unseen
high-tech
fabric
held
up
surprisingly
well
despite
the
devastation
visible
from
the
air
.

Michael
L.
Bandler
,
vice
president
for
network
technology
at
Pacific
Bell
Telephone
Co.
,
says
nearly
all
the
network
's
computer
switches
,
which
move
thousands
of
calls
a
minute
from
one
location
to
another
,
changed
to
battery
power
when
the
city
lost
power
.

The
battery
packs
have
enough
power
for
only
three
hours
,
but
that
gave
emergency
crews
time
to
turn
on
an
emergency
system
that
runs
primarily
on
diesel
fuel
.

Of
some
160
switches
in
Pacific
Bell
's
network
,
only
four
went
down
.

One
of
those
was
in
Hollister
,
Calif.
,
near
the
earthquake
's
epicenter
.

Few
telephone
lines
snapped
.

That
's
because
the
widely
used
fiber-optic
cable
has
been
installed
underground
with
25
extra
feet
of
cable
between
junction
points
.

The
slack
absorbs
the
pulling
strain
generated
by
an
earthquake
.

Nevertheless
,
phone
service
was
sporadic
;
many
computer
terminals
remained
dark
,
and
by
late
yesterday
a
third
of
San
Francisco
remained
without
power
.

Business
in
the
nation
's
fourth-largest
metropolitan
region
was
nearly
paralyzed
;
an
estimated
one
million
members
of
the
work
force
stayed
at
home
.

The
economic
dislocation
was
as
abrupt
as
the
earthquake
itself
,
as
virtually
all
businesses
shut
down
.

The
$
125-billion-a-year
Bay
area
economy
represents
one-fourth
of
the
economy
of
the
nation
's
most
populous
state
and
accounts
for
2
%
to
3
%
of
the
nation
's
total
output
of
goods
and
services
,
according
to
the
Center
for
Continuing
Study
of
the
California
Economy
in
Palo
Alto
.

In
high-tech
,
the
Bay
area
accounts
for
15
%
to
20
%
of
the
U.S.
computer-related
industry
.

``
This
has
been
a
major
disruption
for
the
Bay
area
economy
,
''
says
Pauline
Sweezey
,
the
chief
economist
at
the
California
Department
of
Finance
.

``
Obviously
,
things
are
going
to
have
to
go
on
hold
for
many
companies
.
''

The
damage
to
the
Bay
area
's
roadways
could
cause
significant
economic
hardship
.

A
quarter
of
a
million
people
cross
the
Bay
Bridge
every
day
,
far
more
than
the
100,000
that
use
the
Bay
Area
Rapid
Transit
system
(
BART
)
--
which
was
working
but
was
n't
stopping
in
the
city
's
Financial
District
yesterday
afternoon
because
electricity
was
shut
off
and
the
area
was
being
checked
for
gas
leaks
.

California
state
transportation
officials
interviewed
by
telephone
say
they
nevertheless
do
n't
expect
serious
problems
for
commerce
in
and
out
of
the
Bay
area
.

All
major
roadways
except
Interstate
880
,
known
as
the
Nimitz
Freeway
,
and
the
Bay
Bridge
were
open
by
1
p.m.
yesterday
.

Officials
expect
difficulty
routing
traffic
through
downtown
San
Francisco
.

The
earthquake
caused
many
streets
to
buckle
and
crack
,
making
them
impassible
.

Other
roads
were
obstructed
by
collapsed
buildings
and
damaged
water
and
power
lines
,
an
emergency
relief
spokesman
says
.

San
Francisco
Mayor
Art
Agnos
estimated
the
damage
to
his
city
alone
at
$
2
billion
.

But
many
predicted
that
the
commercial
disruption
would
be
short-lived
.

Of
the
scores
of
companies
contacted
by
this
newspaper
,
few
reported
any
damage
that
they
did
n't
expect
to
have
remedied
within
a
day
or
two
.

It
is
possible
,
of
course
,
that
some
of
the
most
seriously
damaged
companies
could
n't
be
reached
,
particularly
in
areas
nearest
the
epicenter
.

Typical
,
perhaps
,
was
the
situation
at
New
United
Motor
Manufacturing
Inc.
,
the
General
Motors
Corp.-Toyota
joint-venture
auto
plant
in
Fremont
,
about
35
miles
south
of
Oakland
.

Ten
of
the
plant
's
workers
were
injured
when
the
quake
hit
about
a
half-hour
into
the
afternoon
shift
;
seven
were
hospitalized
.

Metal
racks
on
the
plant
floor
fell
over
,
and
water
mains
ruptured
,
a
spokeswoman
says
.

The
plant
was
evacuated
and
workers
sent
home
.

But
the
plant
was
able
to
resume
limited
production
of
its
Toyota
Corollas
and
Geo
Prizms
by
6
a.m.
yesterday
,
and
absenteeism
was
only
7
%
of
the
work
force
,
about
twice
normal
.

Computer
maker
Hewlett-Packard
Co.
,
based
in
Palo
Alto
,
says
one
of
its
buildings
sustained
severe
damage
when
it
was
knocked
off
its
foundation
.

Other
buildings
had
broken
glass
,
dangling
light
fixtures
and
broken
pipes
,
a
spokesperson
says
,
estimating
the
cost
of
reconstruction
``
in
the
millions
.
''

Most
banks
were
closed
but
were
expected
to
reopen
today
with
few
problems
anticipated
.

At
the
Federal
Reserve
Bank
of
San
Francisco
,
Vice
President
Robert
Fienberg
says
operations
were
``
steaming
along
as
usual
''
yesterday
afternoon
.

`
When
the
quake
hit
,
we
turned
on
our
emergency
generator
and
brought
our
computers
up
,
''
he
says
.

The
Fed
serves
as
a
middleman
for
banks
,
taking
checks
from
one
bank
and
sending
them
to
another
,
an
operation
that
it
handled
smoothly
Tuesday
night
after
the
quake
.

``
The
volume
we
received
from
the
banks
was
a
lot
lower
than
usual
,
''
he
says
.

A
disaster-contingency
plan
in
which
the
Los
Angeles
Fed
would
come
to
San
Francisco
's
aid
was
n't
needed
,
he
adds
.

Most
of
the
telephone
problems
in
the
immediate
aftermath
stemmed
from
congestion
.

The
telephone
network
simply
could
n't
handle
the
large
number
of
people
seeking
to
make
a
call
at
the
same
time
.

The
volume
resulted
in
dial-tone
delays
that
were
as
short
as
15
seconds
and
as
long
as
five
minutes
.

Mr.
Bandler
puts
traffic
volume
at
10
to
50
times
normal
.

American
Telephone
&
Telegraph
Co.
,
MCI
Communications
Inc.
and
United
Telecommunications
'
U
S
Sprint
unit
were
blocking
phone
calls
into
the
Bay
area
to
alleviate
congestion
.

The
companies
block
traffic
much
as
highway
on-ramps
are
blocked
when
traffic
backs
up
.

William
E.
Downing
,
Pacific
Bell
's
vice
president
of
customer
services
for
the
Bay
area
,
says
most
long-distance
companies
were
blocking
about
50
%
of
all
calls
.

Pacific
Telesis
says
its
Pacific
Bell
unit
also
was
blocking
about
50
%
of
its
calls
locally
.

Ironically
,
the
long-term
effect
of
the
earthquake
may
be
to
bolster
the
Bay
area
's
economic
fortunes
and
,
indeed
,
the
nation
's
gross
national
product
.

It
may
also
lead
to
new
safeguards
in
major
construction
projects
such
as
double-deck
highways
.

``
It
would
in
the
near-term
give
a
boost
to
the
San
Francisco
economy
because
there
will
be
an
influx
of
people
to
help
,
''
says
Beth
Burnham
Mace
,
a
regional
economist
at
DRI\/McGraw
Hill
,
a
Lexington
,
Mass.
,
forecasting
firm
.

The
construction
industry
is
sure
to
feel
increased
demand
.

``
There
will
be
a
big
influx
of
federal
dollars
and
gains
in
state
,
federal
and
local
employment
,
''
Ms.
Mace
says
.

Adds
Stacy
Kotman
,
an
economist
at
Georgia
State
University
,
``
There
's
nothing
positive
about
an
earthquake
,
but
it
will
probably
generate
more
construction
activity
.
''

Wall
Street
reacted
swiftly
yesterday
to
the
disaster
by
bidding
up
stocks
of
construction
and
related
companies
.

Shares
of
Lone
Star
Industries
Inc.
,
a
cement
maker
,
rose
sharply
in
anticipation
of
stepped-up
demand
.

In
Greenwich
,
Conn.
,
Lone
Star
spokesman
Michael
London
says
,
``
Obviously
with
an
earthquake
of
this
size
,
there
are
likely
to
be
construction
projects
that
would
n't
otherwise
have
been
anticipated
.

But
any
increase
is
n't
likely
to
be
any
kind
of
a
surge
.

It
's
something
likely
to
be
spread
out
over
a
long
period
of
time
.

There
will
be
a
lot
of
repair
work
that
wo
n't
require
the
quantities
of
cement
or
concrete
that
new
constructon
would
.
''

Lone
Star
's
San
Francisco
facilities
were
n't
damaged
in
the
quake
.

The
earthquake
is
likely
to
reduce
GNP
negligibly
in
the
near
term
and
then
could
raise
it
a
bit
as
rebuilding
begins
.

The
first
effects
are
,
of
course
,
negative
as
work
is
disrupted
and
people
lose
income
and
cut
spending
.

Corporate
profits
may
also
dip
initially
.

Many
of
the
lost
tourism
dollars
wo
n't
be
recovered
;
many
trips
delayed
never
take
place
.

Subsequently
,
however
,
the
ill
effects
are
likely
to
be
offset
,
at
least
in
economic
terms
,
as
construction
activity
begins
.

Because
of
the
way
the
government
keeps
its
books
,
the
damage
to
the
Bay
Bridge
,
however
costly
,
wo
n't
be
counted
as
a
minus
.

The
money
spent
on
repairs
will
be
counted
as
a
plus
.

``
It
's
very
difficult
to
model
the
long-term
impact
of
this
,
''
says
Andrew
Goldberg
,
who
studies
the
public-policy
and
crisis-management
aspects
of
earthquakes
at
the
Center
for
Strategic
International
Studies
in
Washington
,
D.C
.

``
You
certainly
can
say
it
's
going
to
be
extremely
severe
.

We
really
are
talking
about
shutting
down
a
major
American
city
for
a
number
of
days
,
maybe
for
a
few
weeks
.
''

Mr.
Goldberg
says
the
cost
of
the
earthquake
will
definitely
top
$
1
billion
and
could
reach
$
4
billion
.

He
cautions
that
early
damage
estimates
are
often
low
;
the
damage
totals
in
Hurricane
Hugo
increased
tenfold
as
more
information
was
received
.

The
earthquake
damage
,
of
course
,
would
have
been
far
greater
if
the
epicenter
had
been
in
downtown
San
Francisco
.

A
direct
hit
on
a
major
city
,
Mr.
Goldberg
figures
,
would
cause
$
20
billion
to
$
40
billion
of
damage
.

Experts
caution
that
it
is
far
too
soon
for
reliable
estimates
of
the
quake
's
total
damage
,
but
it
's
clear
that
insurers
are
likely
to
pay
out
enormous
sums
.

Jack
Byrne
,
the
chairman
of
Fireman
's
Fund
Corp.
,
which
is
based
in
Novato
,
Calif.
,
estimates
insured
losses
resulting
the
earthquake
could
total
$
2
billion
.

The
impact
on
the
insurance
industry
``
will
be
big
and
harsh
,
but
less
than
{
Hurricane
}
Hugo
,
''
says
Mr.
Byrne
,
who
toured
the
Bay
area
by
car
yesterday
afternoon
to
get
a
sense
of
the
company
's
exposure
to
the
earthquake
.

Mr.
Byrne
says
Fireman
's
Fund
will
probably
pay
hundreds
of
millions
in
primary
claims
,
but
,
after
taxes
and
use
of
its
reinsurance
lines
,
the
company
's
fourthquarter
charge
against
earnings
should
n't
top
$
50
million
.

The
company
was
able
to
assess
its
damage
liability
quickly
because
it
has
computerized
maps
of
Northern
California
showing
the
exact
locations
of
all
the
property
it
insures
.

Fireman
's
Fund
had
claims
adjusters
on
the
streets
of
San
Francisco
right
after
sunrise
yesterday
and
was
paying
as
many
claims
as
it
could
right
on
the
spot
.

Fireman
's
Fund
insures
37,300
homes
and
autos
and
35,000
businesses
in
the
Bay
area
.

In
addition
to
paying
for
earthquake
and
fire
damage
,
the
insurer
must
cover
worker-compensation
claims
and
also
losses
due
to
businesses
being
shut
down
by
lack
of
power
or
phone
service
.

But
many
Californians
may
not
have
adequate
insurance
coverage
to
pay
for
damages
to
their
property
.

The
Independent
Insurance
Agents
of
America
says
fewer
than
one
of
every
five
California
homeowners
has
earthquake
insurance
.

A
somewhat
higher
percentage
of
people
living
in
the
Bay
area
have
bought
the
additional
insurance
protection
,
but
the
great
majority
are
n't
covered
.

Earthquake
insurance
typically
runs
$
200
or
more
a
year
for
a
small
house
.

Whatever
the
long-term
economic
effect
,
the
scene
from
the
helicopter
above
Oakland
is
one
of
tragedy
.

Gargantuan
sections
of
a
double-decker
freeway
have
been
heaved
about
like
plastic
building
blocks
.

Atop
them
sit
cars
and
trucks
abandoned
in
a
terrifying
scramble
to
safety
the
day
before
.

In
areas
where
the
freeway
made
giant
concrete
sandwiches
of
itself
lie
cars
that
police
say
have
been
flattened
into
foot-thick
slabs
.

On
the
periphery
,
rescue
workers
seem
,
from
the
air
,
to
move
in
slow
motion
.

They
peck
away
at
the
1
1\/2-mile
section
of
rubble
,
searching
for
more
of
the
250
people
thought
to
have
died
here
.

About
20
other
deaths
were
also
attributed
to
the
earthquake
.

The
heart
of
the
earthquake
,
6.9
on
the
Richter
scale
,
was
50
miles
to
the
south
,
near
Santa
Cruz
,
but
its
terrible
fist
struck
here
on
the
Nimitz
Freeway
,
a
major
artery
serving
the
Bay
Bridge
between
Oakland
and
San
Francisco
.

Along
the
way
,
the
quake
toppled
a
mall
in
Santa
Cruz
,
knocked
down
buildings
in
San
Francisco
's
fashionable
Marina
District
and
sent
a
wall
of
bricks
crashing
on
motorists
in
the
city
's
Financial
District
.

Just
a
short
span
across
the
bay
to
the
west
,
the
quake
also
showed
its
mettle
:
A
four-square-block
area
of
the
Marina
District
lies
smoldering
under
a
steady
stream
of
seawater
being
pumped
onto
rubble
to
prevent
it
from
blazing
anew
.

Many
of
the
buildings
,
mostly
condominiums
and
apartments
,
were
flattened
almost
instantly
as
the
underlying
soil
--
much
of
it
landfill
--
was
literally
turned
to
ooze
by
the
quake
's
intensive
shaking
,
rupturing
gas
lines
.

Onlookers
say
three
persons
died
when
one
of
the
buildings
exploded
into
a
fireball
shortly
after
the
quake
struck
.

Efforts
to
fight
the
blaze
were
hampered
because
water
mains
were
severed
as
well
.

From
the
air
,
ribbons
of
yellow
fire
hose
carry
water
from
the
bay
to
high-pressure
nozzles
trained
on
the
site
.

As
onlookers
stand
behind
barricades
,
helmeted
firemen
and
building
inspectors
survey
rows
of
nearby
buildings
that
were
twisted
from
their
foundations
and
seem
on
the
verge
of
collapse
.

In
the
Marina
District
,
residents
spent
yesterday
assessing
damage
,
cleaning
up
and
trying
to
find
friends
and
neighbors
.

Evelyn
Boccone
,
85
years
old
,
has
lived
in
the
district
most
of
her
life
.

Her
parents
lost
everything
in
the
1906
earthquake
.

``
Now
,
we
realize
what
our
mothers
must
have
gone
through
,
''
she
says
.

``
We
always
heard
about
the
earthquake
,
but
as
children
we
did
n't
always
listen

Resolution

Corp.
plans
to
sell
$
4.5
billion
of
30-year
bonds
Wednesday
in
the
agency
's
first
sale
of
securities
.

The
new
bonds
will
be
dated
Oct.
30
and
mature
Oct.
15
,
2019
.

Tenders
for
the

,
available
in
minimum
denominations
of
$
1,000
,
must
be
received
by
1
p.m.
EDT
Wednesday
at
Federal
Reserve
banks
.

Refcorp
,
created
by
the
thrift-overhaul
law
enacted
in
August
,
will
use
the
proceeds
to
merge
or
sell
off
ailing
savings-and-loan
institutions
.

Congress
authorized
$
50
billion
to
be
borrowed
to
pay
for
the
thrift
bailout
.

Of
that
amount
,
$
20
billion
has
already
been
borrowed
by
the
Treasury
Department
.

Unless
otherwise
specified
in
a
particular
offer
,
the
bonds
wo
n't
be
subject
to
redemption
prior
to
maturity
.

Interest
payments
on
the
bonds
will
be
payable
semiannually
.

The
bonds
are
subject
to
federal
taxation
in
the
U.S.
,
including
income
taxes
.

At
the
state
and
local
level
,
the
bonds
are
subject
to
surtaxes
and
estate
,
inheritance
and
gift
taxes
,
but
exempt
from
taxation
as
to
principal
and
interest

G.D.
Searle
&
Co.
,
a
Monsanto
Co.
unit
,
is
launching
a
program
to
give
consumers
more
information
about
its
drugs
when
doctors
prescribe
them
.

Called
Patients
in
the
Know
,
the
program
features
fact
sheets
designed
to
be
easy
to
understand
.

The
sheets
tell
how
the
medicine
works
,
describe
how
to
use
it
and
list
its
possible
side
effects
.

They
are
designed
to
be
given
to
patients
by
their
doctors
when
the
medicines
are
prescribed
and
include
space
for
the
doctor
to
write
special
instructions
.

In
addition
,
Searle
will
give
pharmacists
brochures
on
the
use
of
prescription
drugs
for
distribution
in
their
stores
.

Consumer
groups
have
long
advocated
that
drug
companies
and
doctors
make
more
information
available
to
patients
.

``
We
believe
that
every
drug
that
's
marketed
to
a
consumer
should
have
a
consumer
label
,
''
said
Douglas
Teich
of
the
Public
Citizen
Health
Research
Group
,
a
Ralph
Nader
affiliate
.

Dr.
Teich
said
Searle
is
``
the
only
company
I
know
that
voluntarily
''
will
make
consumer
information
available
.

According
to
federal
officials
and
drug-industry
studies
,
nearly
half
of
the
1.6
billion
prescriptions
filled
each
year
are
n't
used
properly
,
meaning
that
money
is
wasted
on
some
prescriptions
and
patients
are
deprived
of
the
benefits
of
medication
.

``
We
think
it
's
very
important
to
provide
as
much
information
as
possible
on
the
drugs
consumers
take
,
''
said
Searle
Chairman
Sheldon
Gilgore
.

Bond
prices
rambled
yesterday
as
investors
kept
close
watch
on
the
stock
market
and
worried
about
a
wave
of
new
supply
.

Early
yesterday
,
bonds
rose
as
investors
rushed
to
buy
Treasury
securities
on
the
prospect
that
stocks
would
plummet
in
the
aftermath
of
the
massive
California
earthquake
.

For
example
,
some
securities
analysts
warned
that
stocks
of
certain
insurance
companies
,
which
face
massive
damage
claims
,
would
get
hit
hard
.

But
when
the
Dow
Jones
Industrial
Average
rose
instead
,
bonds
drifted
lower
.

With
stocks
not
a
major
focus
,
``
we
're
waiting
for
the
next
guiding
light
,
''
said
Brian
J.
Fabbri
,
chief
economist
at
Midland
Montagu
Securities
Inc
.

``
If
the
stock
market
tremors
are
behind
us
,
then
the
bond
market
will
go
back
to
looking
at
the
next
batch
of
economic
numbers
to
determine
''
where
interest
rates
are
heading
.

The
Treasury
's
benchmark
30-year
bond
,
which
jumped
3\/8
point
,
or
about
$
3.75
for
each
$
1,000
face
amount
,
during
the
first
hour
of
trading
,
ended
little
changed
.

Interest
rates
barely
budged
from
Tuesday
's
levels
.

Most
junk
bonds
,
which
have
been
battered
in
recent
weeks
,
continued
a
slow
recuperation
and
ended
unchanged
to
slightly
higher
.

But
some
so-called
high-quality
junk
issues
fell
as
some
mutual
funds
sold
their
most
liquid
issues
to
raise
cash
.

RJR
Holdings
Capital
Corp.
's
14.7
%
bonds
due
2009
fell
one
point
.

Other
RJR
issues
fell
between
1\/2
point
and
1
1\/2
point
.

In
the
latest
sign
of
how
difficult
it
is
to
place
certain
junk
bonds
,
Continental
Airlines
said
it
was
forced
to
scale
back
the
size
of
its
latest
offering
.

Continental
,
a
unit
of
Texas
Air
Corp.
,
slashed
the
size
of
its
note
offering
from
$
150
million
to
$
71
million
.

The
move
had
been
widely
expected
.

In
the
multipart
offering
,
the
company
sold
a
portion
of
secured
notes
but
shelved
all
the
unsecured
notes
.

A
Continental
spokeswoman
said
the
notes
may
be
offered
at
a
later
date
.

``
This
was
not
a
do-or-die
deal
,
''
she
said
.

``
I
think
this
is
a
market
that
required
some
level
of
security
.

It
did
not
make
sense
to
offer
unsecured
paper
in
an
unsettling
market
.
''

Investors
have
been
speculating
for
weeks
about
the
market
's
ability
to
place
the
$
7
billion
to
$
10
billion
of
new
junk
bonds
scheduled
to
be
sold
by
year
end
.

Supply
troubles
were
also
on
the
minds
of
Treasury
investors
yesterday
,
who
worried
about
the
flood
of
new
government
securities
coming
next
week
.

``
We
're
being
bombarded
by
new
Treasury
and
agency
debt
offerings
,
''
said
William
Sullivan
Jr.
,
director
of
money-market
research
at
Dean
Witter
Reynolds
Inc
.

``
The
market
is
concerned
about
its
ability
to
underwrite
all
this
debt
at
current
levels
.
''

In
addition
to
the
$
15.6
billion
of
Treasury
bills
to
be
sold
at
next
week
's
regular
Monday
auction
,
the
government
will
sell
$
10
billion
of
new
two-year
Treasury
notes
.

And
Resolution
Funding
Corp.
said
late
yesterday
that
it
will
sell
$
4.5
billion
of
30-year
bonds
Wednesday
.

Refcorp
is
the
financing
unit
of
Resolution
Trust
Corp.
,
a
new
government
agency
created
to
rescue
the
nation
's
troubled
thrifts
.

Its
securities
have
been
dubbed
``
bailout
bonds
''
by
traders
.

In
when-issued
trading
,
the
two-year
Treasurys
had
a
yield
of
about
7.88
%
.

In
the
municipal
market
,
all
eyes
were
on
California
debt
as
investors
tried
to
gauge
the
financial
ramifications
of
Tuesday
's
earthquake
.

But
traders
said
the
quake
had
only
a
minor
impact
on
the
trading
of
California
state
and
local
municipal
debt
.

``
There
are
certain
bonds
traders
refer
to
as
`
earthquake
'
bonds
because
the
(
issuers
)
are
on
top
of
the
San
Andreas
fault
,
''
said
Zane
Mann
,
editor
of
the
California
Municipal
Bond
Advisor
,
a
newsletter
for
investors
.

Since
those
bonds
already
pay
a
slightly
higher
yield
,
an
extra
premium
for
the
earthquake
risk
,
they
were
n't
materially
affected
.

But
some
bond
market
analysts
said
that
could
quickly
change
if
property
casualty
insurance
companies
scramble
to
sell
portions
of
their
municipal
portfolios
to
raise
cash
to
pay
damage
claims
.

``
Insurance
companies
will
foot
a
substantial
amount
of
the
bill
to
reconstruct
San
Francisco
,
''
said
Charles
Lieberman
,
chief
economist
at
Manufacturers
Hanover
Securities
Corp
.

He
also
expects
the
performance
of
municipals
to
lag
Treasurys
as
California
is
forced
to
issue
new
debt
over
time
to
repair
public
facilities
.

A
report
issued
late
yesterday
by
Standard
&
Poor
's
Corp.
concluded
the
quake
wo
n't
cause
``
wide-scale
credit
deterioration
''
for
issuers
and
debt
issues
in
the
12-county
area
of
Northern
California
affected
by
the
quake
.

,
some
California
issues
were
down
a
touch
more
than
the
broad
market
,
but
traders
said
there
had
n't
been
much
investor
selling
because
of
the
quake
.

But
New

general

came
under

stream
of

was
put
up
for

yesterday
,
pushing

up
0.05
percentage
point

Traders
said

were
reacting
to
recent
negative
news
on

are
nervous
ahead
of

Mortgage-Backed
Securities

Mortgage
securities
ended
little
changed
after
light
dealings
.

There
was
no
appreciable
market
impact
from
the
California
earthquake
.

Dealers
said
there
was
some
concern
that
insurance
companies
might
be
forced
to
sell
mortgage
securities
to
help
pay
earthquake-related
claims
,
but
no
selling
materialized
.

The
Federal
Home
Loan
Mortgage
Corp.
and
Federal
National
Mortgage
Association
,
two
dominant
issuers
of
mortgage
securities
,
have
a
sizable
amount
of
California
home
loans
in
their
mortgagebacked
pools
.

But
their
potential
quake
exposure
is
seen
as
small
given
that
they
require
a
financial
cushion
on
all
the
loans
they
purchase
.

And
because
Northern
California
home
prices
are
so
high
,
loans
from
the
region
often
are
too
large
to
be
included
in
Freddie
Mac
and
Fannie
Mae
pools
.

Meanwhile
,
Government
National
Mortgage
Association
9

for
November

Foreign

British
government

The

Traders
said
today
may
be
an
anxious
day
for
the
market
.

Several
key
economic
figures
are
due
out
and
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
Nigel
Lawson
is
scheduled
to
give
the
annual
``
Mansion
House
''
address
to
the
financial
community
.

The
chancellor
sometimes
has
used
the
occasion
to
announce
major
economic
policy
changes
.

Economists
do
n't
expect
any
such
changes
in
this
year
's
address
,
given
Mr.
Lawson
's
apparent
reluctance
to
adjust
policy
currently
.

Meanwhile
,
Japanese
government
bonds
retreated
in
quiet
trading
,
stymied
by
the
dollar
's
resiliency
.

Japan
's
bellwether
4.6
%
bond
due
1998
ended
on
brokers
'
screens
at
95.75
to
yield
5.315
%
.

In
West
Germany
,
investors
stayed
on
the
sidelines
as
the
bond
market
searched
for
direction
.

The
government
's
7
%
issue
due
October
1999
fell
0.05
point
to
99.90
to
yield
7.01
%
.

The
Berlin
Wall
still
stands
.

But
the
man
who
built
it
has
fallen
.

East
Germany
yesterday
removed
Erich
Honecker
,
one
of
the
staunchest
holdouts
against
the
reform
rumbling
through
the
Communist
world
,
in
an
effort
to
win
back
the
confidence
of
its
increasingly
rebellious
citizens
.

But
while
it
was
a
move
that
stunned
the
East
bloc
,
it
hardly
ushers
in
an
era
of
reform
--
at
least
anytime
soon
.

For
the
Politburo
replaced
Mr.
Honecker
,
who
had
led
East
Germany
for
18
years
and
before
that
headed
its
security
apparatus
,
with
a
man
cut
of
the
same
cloth
:
Egon
Krenz
,
the
most
recent
internal-security
chief
and
a
longtime
Honecker
protege
.

East
Germany
,
it
is
clear
,
is
no
Poland
,
where
the
Communist
Party
now
shares
power
with
the
democratically
elected
Solidarity
union
.

Nor
is
it
a
Hungary
,
where
yesterday
the
parliament
approved
constitutional
changes
meant
to
help
turn
the
Communist
nation
into
a
multiparty
democracy
.

Still
,
any
change
in
East
Germany
has
enormous
implications
,
for
both
East
and
West
.

It
raises
the
long-cherished
hopes
of
many
Germans
for
reunification
--
a
prospect
that
almost
equally
alarms
political
leaders
in
Moscow
,
Washington
and
Western
Europe
.

Mr.
Krenz
,
52
,
was
named
the
new
party
chief
just
minutes
after
the
Party
's
163-member
Central
Committee
convened
in
East
Berlin
.

Although
the
East
German
news
agency
ADN
claimed
Mr.
Honecker
had
asked
to
be
relieved
of
his
duties
for
``
health
reasons
,
''
West
German
government
sources
said
the
26-man
Politburo
had
asked
for
his
resignation
at
a
separate
meeting
late
Tuesday
.

(
Mr.
Honecker
was
twice
hospitalized
this
summer
for
a
gall
bladder
ailment
and
his
physical
condition
has
been
the
subject
of
intense
speculation
in
the
Western
media
.
)

ADN
said
Mr.
Honecker
,
a
hard-line
Stalinist
who
in
1961
supervised
the
construction
of
the
Berlin
Wall
,
also
was
relieved
of
his
title
as
head
of
state
and
his
position
as
chief
of
the
military
.

Mr.
Krenz
is
expected
to
be
formally
named
to
all
three
positions
once
the
nation
's
parliament
convenes
later
this
week
.

Mr.
Honecker
's
ignoble
fall
culminates
nearly
two
decades
of
iron-handed
leadership
during
which
Mr.
Honecker
,
now
77
years
old
,
built
East
Germany
into
the
most
economically
advanced
nation
in
the
Soviet
bloc
.

His
grip
on
power
unraveled
this
summer
as
thousands
of
his
countrymen
,
dissatisfied
by
the
harshness
of
his
rule
,
fled
to
the
West
.

Thousands
more
have
taken
to
the
streets
in
the
last
month
in
East
Germany
's
largest
wave
of
domestic
unrest
since
a
workers
'
uprising
in
1953
.

In
Washington
,
the
Bush
administration
took
a
characteristically
cautious
and
skeptical
view
of
the
leadership
change
.

The
official
line
was
to
offer
warmer
ties
to
Mr.
Krenz
,
provided
he
is
willing
to
institute
reforms
.

But
U.S.
officials
have
strong
doubts
that
he
is
a
reformer
.

President
Bush
told
reporters
:
``
Whether
that
{
the
leadership
change
}
reflects
a
change
in
East-West
relations
,
I
do
n't
think
so
.

Because
Mr.
Krenz
has
been
very
much
in
accord
with
the
policies
of
Honecker
.
''

One
top
U.S.
expert
on
East
Germany
added
:
``
There
is
no
clear-cut
champion
of
reform
,
that
we
know
of
,
in
the
East
German
leadership
.
''

Indeed
,
Mr.
Krenz
said
on
East
German
television
last
night
that
there
will
be
no
sharing
of
power
with
pro-democracy
groups
.

He
said
,
while
dialogue
is
important
,
enough
forums
already
exist
``
in
which
different
interests
''
can
express
themselves
.

The
removal
of
Mr.
Honecker
was
apparently
the
result
of
bitter
infighting
within
the
top
ranks
of
the
Communist
party
.

According
to
West
German
government
sources
,
Mr.
Honecker
and
several
senior
Politburo
members
fought
over
the
last
week
to
delay
any
decisions
about
a
leadership
change
.

But
,
with
public
demonstrations
in
the
country
growing
in
size
and
intensity
,
Mr.
Honecker
and
several
key
allies
lost
out
in
this
battle
,
officials
say
.

Those
allies
included
Politburo
members
Guenter
Mittag
,
who
has
long
headed
economic
affairs
,
and
Joachim
Hermann
,
chief
of
information
policy
.

Both
men
were
also
relieved
of
their
duties
yesterday
.

Although
other
resignations
may
follow
,
it
's
still
not
clear
to
what
extent
the
change
in
party
personnel
will
alter
the
government
's
resistance
to
fundamental
change
.

Clearly
,
the
central
figure
in
this
process
is
Egon
Krenz
.

Born
in
1937
in
a
Baltic
Sea
town
now
part
of
Poland
,
he
was
eight
years
old
when
World
War
II
ended
.

Like
West
German
Chancellor
Helmut
Kohl
,
he
represents
the
postwar
generation
that
has
grown
up
during
Germany
's
division
.

Since
joining
the
Politburo
in
1983
as
its
youngest
member
,
Mr.
Krenz
had
acquired
the
nickname
``
crown
prince
,
''
a
reference
to
the
widely
held
view
that
he
was
the
hand-picked
successor
to
Mr.
Honecker
.

In
fact
,
the
two
men
have
had
strikingly
similar
career
paths
,
both
having
served
as
chief
of
internal
security
before
their
rise
to
the
top
party
position
.

Moreover
,
both
men
have
hewn
to
a
similar
hard-line
philosophy
.

Notably
,
one
of
Mr.
Krenz
's
few
official
visits
overseas
came
a
few
months
ago
,
when
he
visited
China
after
the
massacre
in
Beijing
.

He
later
defended
the
Chinese
government
's
response
during
a
separate
visit
to
West
Germany
.

East
German
Protestantism
in
particular
fears
Mr.
Krenz
,
in
part
because
of
an
incident
in
January
1988
when
he
was
believed
to
have
ordered
the
arrest
of
hundreds
of
dissidents
who
had
sought
refuge
in
the
Church
.

However
,
Mr.
Krenz
also
has
a
reputation
for
being
politically
savvy
.

His
shrewd
ability
to
read
the
shifting
popular
mood
in
East
Germany
is
best
illustrated
by
his
apparent
break
with
his
old
mentor
,
Mr.
Honecker
.

Indeed
,
according
to
West
German
government
sources
,
he
was
one
of
the
leaders
in
the
power
struggle
that
toppled
Mr.
Honecker
.

In
recent
days
,
Mr.
Krenz
has
sought
to
project
a
kinder
image
.

According
to
a
report
widely
circulating
in
East
Berlin
,
it
was
Mr.
Krenz
who
ordered
police
to
stop
using
excessive
force
against
demonstrators
in
Leipzig
.

``
He
does
n't
want
to
have
the
image
of
the
gun
man
,
''
says
Fred
Oldenburg
,
an
expert
at
the
Bonn-sponsored
Institute
of
East
European
and
International
Studies
in
Cologne
.

``
He
's
not
a
reformer
--
he
wants
to
have
the
image
of
a
reformer
.
''

As
part
of
his
image
polishing
,
Mr.
Krenz
is
expected
to
take
modest
steps
toward
reform
to
rebuild
confidence
among
the
people
and
reassert
the
party
's
authority
.

Besides
sacking
other
senior
Politburo
officials
who
allied
themselves
with
Mr.
Honecker
,
Mr.
Krenz
could
loosen
controls
on
the
news
media
,
free
up
travel
restrictions
,
and
establish
a
dialogue
with
various
dissident
groups
.

But
will
it
be
enough
?

West
German
government
officials
and
Western
analysts
are
doubtful
.

``
He
does
n't
signify
what
people
want
,
so
the
unrest
will
go
on
,
''
Mr.
Oldenburg
predicts
.

At
the
same
time
,
the
expectations
of
the
East
German
people
are
great
and
will
continue
to
grow
.

Says
one
West
German
official
:
``
What
's
necessary
now
is
the
process
of
democratization
.

Not
just
that
people
are
being
heard
but
that
their
interests
are
being
taken
seriously
.
''

Chancellor
Kohl
,
meanwhile
,
has
invited
Mr.
Krenz
to
open
discussions
with
Bonn
on
a
wide
range
of
subjects
.

Reports
in
the
West
German
press
,
citing
sources
in
East
Germany
,
suggest
Mr.
Krenz
may
serve
only
as
a
bridge
between
Mr.
Honecker
and
a
genuine
reform
leader
.

Adding
to
that
speculation
is
Mr.
Krenz
's
reputation
as
a
heavy
drinker
,
who
is
said
to
also
suffer
from
diabetes
.

``
This
is
a
dynamic
process
and
we
're
experiencing
the
first
step
,
''
the
Bonn
official
adds
.

The
selection
of
Mr.
Krenz
may
also
disappoint
Moscow
.

Soviet
leader
Mikhail
Gorbachev
has
pressed
hard
for
a
change
in
East
Germany
's
rigid
stance
.

Two
reform-minded
party
leaders
favored
by
Moscow
as
possible
successors
to
Mr.
Honecker
,
Dresden
party
secretary
Hans
Modrow
and
Politburo
member
Guenter
Schabowski
,
were
passed
over
.

If
Mr.
Krenz
sticks
to
rigid
policies
the
pressure
from
the
Soviet
Union
could
intensify
.

In
Moscow
,
Mr.
Gorbachev
sent
Mr.
Krenz
a
congratulatory
telegram
that
appeared
to
urge
the
new
leadership
to
heed
growing
calls
for
change
.

According
to
the
Soviet
news
agency
Tass
,
``
Gorbachev
expressed
the
conviction
that
the
leadership
of
the
Socialist
Unity
Party
of
{
East
}
Germany
,
being
sensitive
to
the
demands
of
the
time
,
...
will
find
solutions
to
complicated
problems
the
GDR
{
German
Democratic
Republic
}
encountered
.
''

A
force
of
younger
pro-Gorbachev
members
in
the
East
German
bureaucracy
has
for
some
time
been
pushing
for
relaxation
within
their
country
.

The
older
generation
has
been
torn
between
a
fear
of
tampering
with
the
status
quo
and
a
fear
of
what
might
happen
if
they
did
n't
.

From
the
perspective
of
East
Germany
's
old
guard
,
reforms
that
smack
of
capitalism
and
Western-style
democracy
could
eliminate
their
country
's
reason
for
being
.

Unlike
the
other
nations
of
the
bloc
,
East
Germany
is
a
creature
of
the
Cold
War
.

Erasing
the
differences
still
dividing
Europe
,
and
the
vast
international
reordering
that
implies
,
wo
n't
endanger
the
statehood
of
a
Poland
or
a
Hungary
.

But
it
could
ultimately
lead
to
German
reunification
and
the
disappearance
of
East
Germany
from
the
map
.

Which
is
what
the
Old
Guard
fears
.

``
I
'm
sure
they
'll
formulate
a
reform
that
will
be
a
recipe
for
the
GDR
's
future
as
a
separately
identifiable
state
,
''
says
Michael
Simmons
,
a
British
journalist
whose
book
on
East
Germany
,
entitled
``
The
Unloved
Country
,
''
was
published
this
month
.

Up
to
now
,
that
recipe
has
consisted
of
a
dogged
effort
by
former
leader
Walter
Ulbricht
to
establish
the
country
's
international
legitimacy
,
followed
by
Mr.
Honecker
's
campaign
to
build
the
East
bloc
's
only
successful
Stalinist
economy
into
a
consumer
paradise
.

Neither
man
achieved
perfection
.

Early
in
1987
,
Mr.
Honecker
and
his
team
stopped
paying
thin
compliments
to
Mr.
Gorbachev
and
joined
with
Romania
in
rejecting
any
necessity
for
adjustments
in
their
systems
.

The
less-self-confident
Czechoslovaks
and
Bulgarians
,
in
contrast
,
declared
their
intentions
to
reform
,
while
doing
nothing
concrete
about
it
.

The
East
German
media
soon
began
presenting
Mr.
Gorbachev
's
speeches
only
as
sketchy
summaries
,
and
giving
space
to
his
opponents
.

By
late
1988
,
they
were
banning
Soviet
publications
.

The
country
abandoned
its
former
devotion
to
socialist
unity
and
took
to
insisting
instead
that
each
country
in
the
bloc
ought
to
travel
its
own
road
.

Mr.
Honecker
spoke
of
``
generally
valid
objective
laws
of
socialism
''
and
left
no
room
for
debate
.

With
this
year
's
dislocations
in
China
and
the
Soviet
Union
,
and
the
drive
to
democracy
in
Poland
and
Hungary
,
the
East
German
leadership
grew
still
more
defensive
.

Politburo
member
Joachim
Herrman
confessed
to
a
``
grave
concern
''
over
Hungarian
democracy
.

``
Under
the
banner
that
proclaims
the
`
renewal
of
socialism
,
'
''
he
said
,
``
forces
are
at
work
that
are
striving
to
eliminate
socialism
.
''

Some
loyal
voices
,
in
and
out
of
the
East
German
Communist
party
,
saw
the
nation
's
unrest
coming
.

The
first
signs
were
economic
.

Despite
heavily
subsidized
consumer
industries
,
East
Germans
have
for
years
watched
the
West
pull
farther
out
ahead
.

In
1988
,
for
the
first
time
,
economic
growth
came
to
a
dead
stop
.

Gingerly
,
some
economists
began
to
blame
central
planning
.

Some
writers
in
theoretical
journals
even
raised
the
notion
of
introducing
democracy
,
at
least
in
the
workplace
.

By
summer
,
an
independent
reform
movement
was
saying
out
loud
what
it
had
only
whispered
before
.

But
they
are
stalwart
socialists
.

Their
proclaimed
purpose
is
to
cleanse
East
Germany
of
its
Stalinist
muck
,
not
to
merge
with
the
West
.

One
of
their
pastors
has
envisioned
a
``
new
utopia
''
of
``
creative
socialism
.
''

Meanwhile
,
the
man
Mr.
Krenz
replaces
has
left
an
indelible
mark
on
East
German
society
.

Imprisoned
by
the
Nazis
during
World
War
II
for
his
political
beliefs
,
Mr.
Honecker
typified
the
postwar
generation
of
committed
Communist
leaders
in
Eastern
Europe
who
took
their
cues
from
Moscow
.

He
was
a
``
socialist
warrior
''
who
felt
rankled
by
West
Germany
's
enormous
postwar
prosperity
and
the
Bonn
government
's
steadfast
refusal
to
recognize
the
legitimacy
of
his
state
.

Finally
,
during
his
first
and
only
state
visit
to
Bonn
two
years
ago
,
he
won
some
measure
of
the
recognition
he
had
long
sought
.

But
ultimately
he
was
undone
by
forces
unleashed
by
his
own
comrade
,
Mr.
Gorbachev
.

Mr.
Honecker
's
removal
``
was
bound
to
happen
,
''
says
one
aide
to
Chancellor
Kohl
.

``
It
was
only
a
matter
of
time
.
''

The
European
Community
Commission
increased
its
forecast
for
economic
growth
in
the
EC
in
1989
to
3.5
%
,
slightly
higher
than
its
June
projection
of
3.25
%
.

In
its
annual
economic
report
for
1989-1990
,
the
commission
also
projected
1990
gross
domestic
product
growth
for
the
12
EC
members
at
3
%
.

EC
inflation
was
seen
at
4.8
%
in
1989
,
higher
than
1988
's
3.6
%
price
rise
.

However
,
inflation
for
1990
was
seen
slowing
to
4.5
%
.

Leading
EC
growth
forecasts
in
1989
was
Ireland
,
seen
growing
5
%
at
constant
prices
.

Slower
growth
countries
included
Greece
,
at
2.5
%
,
the
U.K.
,
at
2.25
%
,
and
Denmark
,
at
1.75
%
.

Inflation
is
expected
to
be
highest
in
Greece
,
where
it
is
projected
at
14.25
%
,
and
Portugal
,
at
13
%
.

At
the
other
end
of
the
spectrum
,
West
German
inflation
was
forecast
at
3
%
in
1989
and
2.75
%
in
1990
.

Nestle
Korea
Ltd.
opened
a
coffee
and
non-dairy-creamer
plant
in
Chongju
,
South
Korea

An
official
at
Nestle
Korea
,
a
50-50
joint
venture
between
Nestle
S.A.
and
the
Doosan
Group
,
said
the
new
facility
will
manufacture
all
types
of
soluble
,
roasted
and
ground
coffee
,
coffee
mix
and
nondairy
coffee
creamer
.

The
South
Korean
coffee
market
,
consisting
mostly
of
instant
coffee
,
was
estimated
at
about
100
billion
won
(
$
150.7
million
)
last
year
.

Brands
made
by
the
Kraft
General
Foods
unit
of
Philip
Morris
Cos.
had
about
95
%
of
the
market
share
.

Nestle
currently
has
only
about
a
2
%
share
with
its
Taster
's
Choice
coffee

Poland
plans
to
start
negotiations
soon
on
purchasing
natural
gas
from
Iran
,
the
official
Islamic
Republic
News
Agency
reported
.

The
agency
said
Polish
Prime
Minister
Tadeusz
Mazowiecki
told
Iranian
Deputy
Foreign
Minister
Mahmoud
Vaezi
of
Poland
's
willingess
to
purchase
the
gas
during
Mr.
Vaezi
's
current
visit
to
Warsaw
.

The
agency
did
n't
mention
possible
quantities
and
did
n't
say
how
the
gas
would
be
delivered
.

A
Chinese
official
harshly
criticized
plans
to
close
a
British
naval
base
in
downtown
Hong
Kong
.

Hong
Kong
officials
announced
last
week
that
the
base
will
be
relocated
to
a
small
island
to
allow
downtown
redevelopment
.

But
Beijing
wants
to
use
the
base
for
the
People
's
Liberation
Army
after
1997
,
when
the
territory
returns
to
Chinese
sovereignty
.

Ke
Zaishuo
,
head
of
China
's
delegation
to
a
Chinese-British
Liaison
Committee
on
Hong
Kong
,
accused
Britain
of
trying
to
impose
a
fait
accompli
and
said
,
``
This
is
something
we
can
not
accept
.

The
Israeli
and
Soviet
national
airlines
have
reached
preliminary
agreement
for
launching
the
first
direct
flights
between
Tel
Aviv
and
Moscow
,
a
spokesman
for
the
Israeli
airline
,
El
Al
,
said
.

El
Al
director
Rafi
Har-Lev
and
top
officials
of
the
Soviet
Union
's
Aeroflot
negotiated
a
preliminary
pact
in
Moscow
this
week
,
the
spokesman
said
.

He
added
that
concluding
the
deal
requires
approval
by
the
governments
of
both
countries
,
which
have
never
had
direct
air
links
.

The
chairman
and
a
director
of
one
of
the
Republic
of
Singapore
's
leading
property
companies
,
City
Development
Ltd.
,
or
CDL
,
were
charged
yesterday
with
criminal
breach
of
trust
of
some
800,000
Singapore
dollars
(
about
US$
409,000
)
.

Kwek
Hong
Png
,
chairman
of
CDL
,
and
director
Quek
Leng
Chye
were
arrested
by
the
republic
's
Corrupt
Practices
Investigation
Bureau
Tuesday
night
.

In
addition
to
abetting
in
the
alleged
criminal
breach
of
trust
,
Kwek
Hong
Png
was
also
charged
with
dishonestly
receiving
S$
500,000
that
had
been
stolen
.

Both
men
were
charged
in
a
subordinate
court
and
released
on
bail
of
S$
1
million
.

The
charges
are
the
culmination
of
weeks
of
rumors
concerning
CDL
that
have
depressed
the
company
's
share
price
and
to
a
lesser
extent
the
shares
of
all
companies
owned
by
CDL
's
controlling
Quek
family
,
brokers
in
Singapore
say
.

The
Queks
control
the
Hong
Leong
Group
,
which
has
widespread
interests
in
manufacturing
,
property
and
finance
in
both
Malaysia
and
Singapore
.

News
of
the
arrest
and
charging
of
the
two
men
helped
to
push
prices
on
the
Singapore
Stock
market
sharply
lower
in
early
trading
yesterday
,
but
brokers
said
that
the
market
and
CDL
shares
recovered
once
it
became
apparent
the
charges
were
limited
to
the
two
men
personally

here
indicted
Norton
Co.
's
former
director
of
advanced-ceramics
research
,
charging
him
with
interstate
transportation
of
stolen
property
.

Norton
and

last
month
filed
a
lawsuit
against
the
former
research
manager
,
Chien-Min
Sung
,
charging
him
with
stealing
trade
secrets
.

Mr.
Sung
formerly
worked
at
General
Electric
in
research
on
synthetic
diamonds
.

The
criminal
charges
brought
against
him
involved
GE
technology
,
according
the
court
documents
.

If
convicted
,
he
could
be
imprisoned
for
up
to
10
years
and
fined
$
250,000
.

Mr.
Sung
could

earlier

As
the
citizens
of
San
Francisco
and
surrounding
communities
began
assessing
the
damage
from
Tuesday
's
devastating
earthquake
,
NBC
News
began
assessing
the
damage
from
what
some
said
was
a
failure
to
provide
comprehensive
coverage
in
the
earthquake
's
initial
moments
.

``
In
terms
of
coverage
,
it
was
a
disaster
equal
to
the
earthquakes
,
''
said
Eric
Premner
,
president
for
broadcasting
of
King
Broadcasting
Co.
,
which
owns
the
NBC
affiliate
in
Seattle
,
Wash
.

While
rival
ABC
News
outstripped
the
competition
in
live
coverage
of
the
event
by
sheer
luck
--
the
network
was
broadcasting
the
World
Series
from
Candlestick
Park
when
the
quake
struck
--
NBC
News
was
unable
to
get
its
signal
out
of
San
Francisco
for
the
first
hour
after
the
quake
.

``
I
have
to
attribute
the
lackluster
performance
to
a
natural
disaster
,
''
said
Mr.
Premner
.

``
So
before
I
start
to
be
really
critical
of
NBC
,
I
would
like
to
know
more
about
what
happened
.
''

There
were
no
complaints
from
affiliates
of
CBS
Inc.
and
Cable
News
Network
,
a
unit
of
Turner
Broadcasting
System
Inc
.

But
that
was
not
the
case
at
NBC
News
,
which
has
been
dogged
with
the
image
of
not
being
aggressive
on
major
breaking
stories
.

Last
summer
,
the
affiliates
bitterly
complained
to
network
executives
about
the
poor
coverage
of
the
student
uprising
in
China
.

``
I
was
not
pleased
with
the
slow
start
,
and
neither
was
NBC
News
,
''
said
Guy
Hempel
,
general
manager
of
NBC
affiliate
WAVE
in
Louisville
,
Ky
.

A
spokesman
for
National
Broadcasting
Co.
,
a
unit
of
General
Electric
Co.
,
said
the
network
was
``
looking
into
what
happened
.
''

The
stations
said
they
were
pleased
with
the
extended
coverage
yesterday
,
including
a
special
five-hour
edition
of
``
Today
.
''

Don
Browne
,
director
of
news
at
NBC
News
,
said
in
an
interview
that
``
we
could
n't
get
a
signal
out
of
San
Francisco
.

We
were
out
of
the
box
.

It
was
horrible
.

The
comment
we
're
hearing
is
that
we
were
slow
out
of
the
box
,
but
beat
everyone
else
in
the
stretch
.
''

NBC
broadcast
throughout
the
entire
night
and
did
not
go
off
the
air
until
noon
yesterday
.

The
quake
postponed
the
third
and
fourth
games
of
the
World
Series
.

In
place
of
the
games
,
ABC
said
it
planned
to
broadcast
next
week
's
episodes
of
its
prime-time
Wednesday
and
Thursday
lineups
,
except
for
a
one-hour
special
on
the
earthquake
at
10
p.m.
last
night
.

The
series
is
scheduled
to
resume
Tuesday
evening
in
San
Francisco
.

``
There
are
no
commercials
to
make
up
for
since
we
're
going
to
eventually
broadcast
the
World
Series
,
''
said
a
network
spokesman
.

Pinnacle
West
Capital
Corp.
said
it
suspended
indefinitely
its
common
stock
dividend
and
reported
a
91
%
plunge
in
third-quarter
net
income
.

The
announcement
,
made
after
the
close
of
trading
,
caught
analysts
by
surprise
.

The
company
closed
at
$
12
a
share
,
down
62.5
cents
,
in
composite
trading
on
the
New
York
Stock
Exchange
.

Pinnacle
West
slashed
its
quarterly
dividend
to
40
cents
per
share
from
70
cents
in
December
,
saying
at
the
time
that
it
believed
the
new
,
lower
dividend
was
``
sustainable
.
''

A
company
spokesman
said
the
decision
to
eliminate
the
dividend
resulted
from
a
quarterly
appraisal
and
that
circumstances
had
changed
since
the
December
announcement
.

He
declined
to
elaborate
.

Edward
J.
Tirello
Jr.
,
an
analyst
at
Shearson
Lehman
Hutton
Inc.
,
speculated
that
the
sudden
dividend
elimination
presages
an
expensive
agreement
with
thrift
regulators
over
the
company
's
insolvent
MeraBank
savings
and
loan
unit
.

Analysts
have
estimated

The

at
the

in
the

period
,
had
a
26
%
drop
in
profit
,
to
$
86.3
million
,
largely
as
a
result
of
outages
at
the

's
huge
Palo

facility
and
the
cost
of

power
.

In

in
the

,
compared
with
a

a

The

As

Equitec

said
it
will
ask
as
many
as
100,000
investors
in

of
its
public
real-estate
limited
partnerships
to
give
approval
to
rolling
them
up
into
a
new
master
limited

.

Under
the
proposal
by
Equitec
,
a
financially
troubled
real-estate
syndicator
,
New
York-based
Hallwood
Group
Inc.
would
replace
Equitec
as
the
newly
formed
master
limited
partnership
's
general
partner
and
manager
.

Shares
of
the
new
partnership
would
trade
on
an

like

Hallwood
is
a

bank
whose
activities
include
the
ownership
,
management
and
financial
restructuring
of

,
office
buildings
,
apartments
and
other
real

.

In
a
statement
,
Equitec
Chairman
Richard
L.
Saalfeld
said
the
transfer
will
benefit
both
the
company
and
investors
in
the
12
limited
partnerships
included
in
the
proposed
rollup
.

While
he
did
n't
describe
the
partnerships
'
financial
condition
,
he
said
their
operations
``
continue
to
drain
the
resources
of
Equitec

Because
of
Tuesday
's
earthquake
in
Northern
California
,
company
officials
could
n't
immediately
be
reached
for
additional
comment
.

A
spokesman
for
Hallwood
said
the
12
limited
partnerships
,
which
were
marketed
by
brokerage
firms
and
financial
planners
between
1979
and
1984
,
raised
several
hundred
million
dollars
from
investors
.

With
airline
deals
in
a
tailspin
,
legendary
Wall
Street
trader
Michael
Steinhardt
could
have
trouble
parachuting
out
of
USAir
Group
,
traders
say
.

Only
a
week
ago
,
when
airline
buy-out
fever
was
already
winding
down
,
Mr.
Steinhardt
was
engaged
in
a
duel
with
USAir
.

He
was
threatening
to
take
over
the
carrier
,
after
spending
an
estimated
$
167
million
to
build
an
8.4
%
USAir
stake
for
his
investment
clients
.

The
would-be
raider
even
hired
an
investment
banker
to
give
teeth
to
his
takeover
threat
,
which
was
widely
interpreted
as
an
effort
to
flush
out
an
acquirer
for
USAir
,
or
for
his
own
stake
.

In
fighting
USAir
,
Mr.
Steinhardt
was
pitted
against
another
investor
,
billionnaire
Warren
Buffett
,
who
bought
into
USAir
to
help
fend
off
Mr.
Steinhardt
.

Mr.
Buffett
's
firm
,
Berkshire
Hathaway
,
holds
a
much
bigger
stake
in
the
carrier
than
Mr.
Steinhardt
's
firm
,
Steinhardt
Partners
.

Now
,
in
the
wake
of
UAL
's
troubles
in
financing
its
buy-out
,
the
airline
raiding
game
has
been
grounded
.

Instead
of
hoping
to
sell
his
USAir
stake
at
analysts
'
estimated
buy-out
price
of
$
80
a
share
,
Mr.
Steinhardt
is
stuck
with
roughly
3.7
million
USAir
shares
that
cost
him
$
45
,
on
average
,
but
yesterday
closed
at
40
1\/2
,
up
1\/4
,
in
New
York
Stock
Exchange
composite
trading
.

``
It
does
n't
make
sense
to
parachute
out
at
this
price
,
''
Mr.
Steinhardt
says
,
though
he
has
stopped
his
takeover
talk
and
now
commends
USAir
managers
'
``
operating
skills
.
''

At
the
current
price
,
the
USAir
holding
represents
9
%
of
all
the
assets
that
Mr.
Steinhardt
manages
.

A
week
ago
,
USAir
stock
briefly
soared
above
52
after
a
report
in
USA
Today
that
Mr.
Steinhardt
might
launch
a
hostile
bid
for
the
carrier
,
though
takeover
speculators
say
they
were
skeptical
.

``
If
USAir
is
worth
80
as
a
takeover
and
the
stock
went
to
52
,
the
market
was
saying
Steinhardt
's
presence
was
n't
worth
anything
,
in
terms
of
getting
a
deal
done
,
''
says
a
veteran
takeover
speculator
.

Traders
say
this
all
goes
to
show
that
even
the
smartest
money
manager
can
get
infected
with
crowd
passions
.

In
trying
to
raid
USAir
,
Mr.
Steinhardt
abandoned
his
usual
role
as
a
passive
investor
,
and
ran
into
snags
.

Moreover
,
unlike
Mr.
Buffett
,
who
often
holds
big
stakes
in
companies
for
years
,
Mr.
Steinhardt
has
n't
in
the
past
done
much
long-term
investing
.

Mr.
Steinhardt
,
who
runs
about
$
1.7
billion
for
Steinhardt
Partners
,
made
his
name
as
a
gunslinging
trader
,
moving
in
and
out
of
stocks
with
agility
--
enriching
himself
and
his
investment
clients
.

Meanwhile
,
his
big
losses
,
for
instance
in
1987
's
crash
,
generally
have
been
trading
losses
.

So
,
some
see
a
special
irony
in
the
fact
that
Mr.
Steinhardt
,
the
trader
,
now
is
encumbered
with
a
massive
,
illiquid
airline
holding
.

Analysts
say
USAir
stock
might
lose
four
or
five
points
if
the
Steinhardt
stake
was
dumped
all
at
once
.

As
a
result
,
Mr.
Steinhardt
must
reconcile
himself
to
selling
USAir
at
a
loss
,
or
to
holding
the
shares
as
an
old-fashioned
investment
.

``
Long-term
investing
--
that
's
not
Steinhardt
's
style
,
''
chuckles
an
investor
who
once
worked
at
Steinhardt
Partners
.

``
He
does
n't
usually
risk
that
much
unless
he
thinks
he
has
an
ace
in
the
hole
,
''
adds
another
Steinhardt
Partners
alumnus
.

In
recent
days
,
traders
say
USAir
has
been
buying
its
own
shares
,
as
part
of
a
program
to
retire
about
eight
million
USAir
shares
,
though
the
carrier
wo
n't
discuss
its
buy-back
program
.

If
USAir
stepped
up
its
share
purchases
,
that
might
be
a
way
for
Mr.
Steinhardt
to
get
out
,
says
Timothy
Pettee
,
a
Merrill
Lynch
analyst
.

But
USAir
might
not
want
to
help
Mr.
Steinhardt
,
he
adds
.

In
1987
,
USAir
Chairman
Edwin
Colodny
stonewalled
when
Trans
World
Airlines
Chairman
Carl
Icahn
threatened
to
take
over
the
carrier
.

Mr.
Icahn
,
a
much
more
practiced
raider
than
Mr.
Steinhardt
,
eventually
sold
a
big
USAir
stake
at
a
tiny
profit
through
Bear
,
Stearns
.

Mr.
Steinhardt
also
could
take
that
route
.

He
confers
big
trading
commissions
on
Wall
Street
firms
.

However
,
with
airline
stocks
cratering
,
he
might
not
get
a
very
good
price
for
his
shares
,
traders
say
.

Especially
galling
for
Mr.
Steinhardt
,
say
people
close
to
him
,
is
that
USAir
's
Mr.
Colodny
wo
n't
even
take
his
telephone
calls
.

While
USAir
is
n't
considered
absolutely
takeover-proof
,
its
defenses
,
including
the
sale
in
August
of
a
12
%
stake
in
the
company
to
Mr.
Buffett
's
Berkshire
Hathaway
,
are
pretty
strong
.

USAir
's
deal
with
Mr.
Buffett
``
was
n't
exactly
a
shining
example
of
shareholder
democracy
,
''
Mr.
Steinhardt
says
.

Since
last
April
,
the
investor
has
made
seven
so-called
13D
filings
in
USAir
,
as
he
bought
and
sold
the
company
's
stock
.

Such
disclosures
of
big
holdings
often
are
used
by
raiders
to
try
to
scare
a
company
's
managers
,
and
to
stir
interest
in
the
stock
.

But
of
course
it
would
be
highly
unusual
for
an
investment
fund
such
as
Steinhardt
Partners
to
take
over
a
company
.

USAir
and
Mr.
Buffett
wo
n't
talk
about
Mr.
Steinhardt
at
all
.

Analysts
say
USAir
has
great
promise
.

By
the
second
half
of
1990
,
USAir
stock
could
hit
60
,
says
Helane
Becker
of
Shearson
Lehman
Hutton
.

She
thinks
traders
should
buy
the
stock
if
it
tumbles
to
35
.

But
meanwhile
,
USAir
is
expected
to
show
losses
or
lackluster
profit
for
several
quarters
as
it
tries
to
digest
Piedmont
Airlines
,
which
it
acquired
.

Moreover
,
some
investors
think
a
recession
or
renewed
airfare
wars
will
pummel
airline
stocks
in
coming
months
.

However
,
Mr.
Steinhardt
says
he
's
``
comfortable
holding
USAir
as
an
investment
.
''

While
he
has
bought
and
sold
some
USAir
shares
in
recent
days
,
he
says
that
contrary
to
rumors
,
he
has
n't
tried
to
unload
his
holding
.

Mr.
Steinhardt
adds
that
he
bought
USAir
stock
earlier
this
year
as
``
part
of
a
fundamental
investment
in
the
airline
group
.
''

In
1989
,
Mr.
Steinhardt
says
he
made
money
trading
in
Texas
Air
,
AMR
and
UAL
.

Overall
,
his
investments
so
far
this
year
are
showing
gains
of
about
20
%
,
he
adds
.

Does
Mr.
Steinhardt
regret
his
incursion
into
the
takeover-threat
game
?

People
close
to
the
investor
say
that
was
an
experiment
he
is
unlikely
to
repeat
.

``
I
do
n't
think
you
'll
find
I
'm
making
a
radical
change
in
my
traditional
investment
style
,
''
Mr.
Steinhardt
says
.

Addington
Resources
Inc.
said
it
called
for
redemption
on
Nov.
21
its
$
25.8
million
outstanding
of
8
%
convertible
subordinated
debentures
due
2013
.

The
debentures
were
issued
in
the
face
amount
of
$
46
million
on
July
11
,
1988
,
the
Ashland
,
Ky.
,
coal
mining
,
water
transportation
and
construction
company
said
.

The
company
said
the
redemption
is
permitted
because
the
price
of
Addington
's
stock
has
equaled
or
exceeded
$
19.60
for
20
consecutive
trading
days
,
a
condition
set
in
the
terms
of
the
debentures
.

Debenture
holders
are
expected
to
convert
most
of
the
debentures
into
common
because
the
value
of
the
stock
received
in
a
conversion
would
exceed
the
$
1,103.11
redemption
price
.

Commodore
International
Ltd.
said
it
will
report
a
loss
for
the
first
quarter
ended
Sept.
30
because
sales
of
personal
computers
for
the
home
market
remained
weak
in
some
major
countries
.

That
will
mark
the
second
consecutive
quarterly
loss
for
Commodore
and
will
raise
additional
questions
about
whether
it
can
sustain
the
turnaround
it
had
seemed
to
be
engineering
.

Commodore
,
West
Chester
,
Pa.
,
had
said
in
August
that
it
was
consolidating
manufacturing
to
cut
costs
and
expected
to
be
profitable
in
the
fiscal
first
quarter
.

Commodore
said
that
its
announcement
is
based
on
preliminary
information
and
that
the
situation
could
look
different
by
the
time
final
results
are
announced
early
next
month
.

In
fact
,
Commodore
's
fiscal
fourth-quarter
loss
was
$
2
million
narrower
than
Commodore
had
expected
a
few
weeks
after
the
quarter
closed
.

Still
,
even
results
approaching
break-even
would
mark
a
sharp
weakening
compared
with
fiscal
1989
first-quarter
earnings
of
$
9.6
million
,
or
30
cents
a
share
,
on
sales
of
$
200.2
million
.

Reflecting
concerns
about
Commodore
's
outlook
,
its
stock
has
plunged
more
than
50
%
since
May
,
closing
yesterday
unchanged
at
$
8.875
a
share
in
composite
trading
on
the
New
York
Stock
Exchange
.

The
price
can
be
expected
to
erode
further
,
because
the
loss
estimate
came
after
the
market
closed
.

Commodore
has
seemed
to
be
setting
the
stage
recently
for
progress
in
the
U.S.
,
where
its
personal-computer
sales
have
been
so
dismal
for
years
that
Commodore
is
close
to
dropping
off
research
firms
'
market-share
charts
.

Commodore
has
assembled
an
experienced
management
team
,
it
has
persuaded
many
more
dealers
to
carry
its
products
and
it
has
unleashed
a
slick
advertising
campaign
.

But
those
represent
long-term
strategies
that
probably
wo
n't
succeed
quickly
,
even
if
they
turn
out
to
be
the
right
ones
.

In
the
meantime
,
the
strategies
will
increase
expenses
.

Commodore
had
been
counting
on
its
consumer
business
to
stay
sufficiently
healthy
to
support
its
efforts
in
other
areas
--
mainly
in
getting
schools
and
businesses
to
use
its
Amiga
,
which
has
slick
graphics
yet
has
been
slow
to
catch
on
because
it
is
n't
compatible
with
Apple
Computer
Inc.
or
International
Business
Machines
Corp.
hardware
.

But
sales
to
consumers
have
become
difficult
during
the
past
several
months
,
even
in
West
Germany
,
which
has
been
by
far
Commodore
's
strongest
market
.

The
Commodore
64
and
128
,
mainly
used
for
children
's
educational
software
and
games
,
had
surprised
market
researchers
by
continuing
to
produce
strong
sales
even
though
other
low-profit
personal
computers
now
operate
several
times
as
fast
and
have
much
more
memory
.

Commodore
has
said
it
expects
sales
to
rebound
,
but
market
researchers
have
said
that
sales
of
the
low-end
products
may
finally
be
trailing
off
.

plunge
late

and
its

Monday
,
as
players

to
set
their

coming

Composite

gained

to

.

Some
822
New

Stock
Exchange
issues
advanced
in
price
,
while
668
declined
.

But
the
Dow
Jones
Transportation
Average
went
down
for
the
seventh
consecutive
session
,
due
largely
to
further
selling
in
UAL
.

The
average
dropped
6.40
to
1247.87
and
has
now
lost
21.7
%
of
its
value
since
the
losing
streak
began
Oct.
10
.

Big
Board
volume
dropped
to
166,900,000
shares
,
in
line
with
the
level
of
trading
over
the
past
few
weeks
,
from
224.1
million
Tuesday
.

Traders
cited
anticipation
of
the
consumer
price
report
for
September
,
due
today
,
and
tomorrow
's
expiration
of
October
stock-index
futures
and
options
as
major
factors
in
the
slowdown
.

In
addition
,
activity
at
a
number
of
San
Francisco-based
brokerage
houses
was
curtailed
as
a
result
of
the
earthquake
,
which
knocked
out
power
lines
and
telephone
service
throughout
the
Bay
area
.

Stocks
retreated
to
session
lows
just
after
the
opening
amid
worries
about
the
market
impact
of
the
quake
,
but
quickly
snapped
back
to
higher
levels
with
the
help
of
futures-related
program
buying
.

The
early
move
essentially
established
the
day
's
trading
range
,
and
traders
said
they
saw
little
of
the
program
activity
that
has
battered
the
market
recently
.

``
I
did
n't
expect
it
to
be
this
quiet
.

I
expected
to
see
more
volatility
as
some
of
the
institutions
who
were
spooked
last
Friday
did
some
selling
,
''
said
Raymond
F.
DeVoe
,
a
market
strategist
at
Legg
Mason
Wood
Walker
,
Baltimore
.

Mr.
DeVoe
said
he
expects
prices
to
show
some
renewed
instability
over
the
next
few
sessions
as
institutions
re-evaluate
their
stance
toward
the
market
in
light
of
its
decline
.

``
I
would
suspect
that
a
lot
of
investment
committees
are
looking
into
whether
(
they
)
want
to
be
in
stocks
at
all
,
''
he
said
.

Insurance
stocks
were
sold
at
the
opening
amid
concerns
about
the
level
of
damage
claims
the
companies
would
receive
as
a
result
of
the
earthquake
.

But
those
issues
recovered
quickly
and
turned
higher
because
of
expectations
that
the
quake
and
the
recent
Hurricane
Hugo
would
set
the
stage
for
an
increase
in
premium
rates
.

Issues
of
insurance
brokers
were
especially
strong
.

Granges
Inc.
,
citing
depressed
gold
prices
,
said
it
plans
to
suspend
operations
for
an
indefinite
period
at
its
Tartan
gold
mine
in
Manitoba
.

Granges
said
in
Vancouver
,
British
Columbia
,
that
the
production
halt
will
be
phased
in
over
a
10-week
period
.

Tartan
currently
produces
gold
at
a
cash
operating

,
which
is
high
by
industry
standards
and
$

so
above
the

Granges
said
it
also
plans
in

down
the
carrying
value
of
the
Tartan
mine
by
2.5
million

Computer

they
agreed
to
jointly
develop

to
help

carved
out
a

computers
but
needs
to
find
new
markets
if
it
is
to
maintain
its
growth
rate
of
30
%
and
more
each
year
.

The
market
for
system-management
software
for
Digital
's
hardware
is
fragmented
enough
that
a
giant
such
as
Computer
Associates
should
do
well
there
.

At
the
same
time
,
the
market
is
smaller
than
the
market
for
IBM-compatible
software
.

For
one
thing
,
Digital
,
Maynard
,
Mass.
,
has
sold
fewer
machines
.

In
addition
,
its
machines
are
typically
easier
to
operate
,
so
customers
require
less
assistance
from
software
.

Wang

,
beset

reported
a

.

Revenue
fell
12.7
%
to
$
596.8
million
from
$
684

,
although
some
of
the
decline
was
caused
by
discontinued

.

Wang
had
previously
forecast
a
loss
.

The
company
reiterated
that
it
expects
another
loss
in
the
second
quarter
and
for
the
full
year
,
although
it
expects
a
profitable
fourth
quarter
.

A
year

,
Wang
had
earnings
of
$
13.1
million
,
or
eight
cents
a

,
in
its
first
quarter
,
including
a
$

The

loss
included

Dayton
Hudson
Corp.
said
it
accepted
for
purchase
seven
million
common
shares
at
$
62.875

,
under
the
terms
of
a
Dutch
auction
self-tender
offer
.

The
offer
expired
at
12:01
a.m.
yesterday
.

In
a
Dutch
auction
,
the
buyer
sets
a
price
range
and
holders
give
a
price
in
that
range
at
which
they
're
willing
to
sell
their
shares
.

The
buyer
then
picks
a
price
and
buys
shares
at
that
price
from
holders
who
offered
to
sell
at
that
price
or
lower
.

Dayton
Hudson
's
repurchase
offer
,
representing
about
9
%
of
its
common
shares
outstanding
,
had
established
a
range
of
between
$
60
and
$
65
for
the
buy-back
.

Dayton
Hudson
said
it
accepted
all
odd-lot

price
;
the
preliminary
proration

from
the

.

The
$

was
offset
by
lower

Enron
Corp.
said
a
subsidiary
and
two
United
Kingdom
firms
are
studying
the
feasibility
of
constructing
a
1,500
megawatt
gas-fired
power
plant
in
northern
England
as
an

Enron

A
subsidiary
of
Britain
's
Imperial
Chemical

would
buy
electricity

steam
from
the
proposed

.

Surplus
power
would
be
sold

,
reported
that
its
third-quarter
loss
widened
to
$
21.7
million
,
or

primarily
because
of

March
.

The
communications
and
entertainment
company
said
revenue
rose
to
$
345.5
million
,
from
$
311.6
million
.

Viacom
attributed
the
improvement
to
higher
earnings
from
operations
in
its
networks
segment
,
which
includes
the
MTV
and
Showtime
networks
.

Viacom
said
it
also
restructured
bank
debt
under
a
$
1.5
billion
unsecured
bank
agreement
that
offers
significant
interest
rate
savings
.

Sumner
M.
Redstone
,
Viacom
's
chairman
,
said
Viacom
``
emerged
from
our
leveraged
buy-out
structure
and
gained
substantial
operating
and
financial
flexibility
through
''
the
bank
pact
.

Trinova
Corp.
,
Maumee
,
Ohio
,
said
it
is
launching
an
extensive
restructuring
of
its
core
business
,
and
took
a
charge
that
resulted
in
a
loss
of
$
29.7
million
,
or
87
cents
a
share
,
for
the
third
quarter
.

Trinova
said
it
will
close
,
move
or
overhaul
40
of
its
170
manufacturing
facilities
and
over
the
next
three
years
cut
1,500
jobs
from
its
current
world-wide
payroll
of
22,300
employees
.

Most
of
the
factory
closings
and
job
cutbacks
will
affect
Trinova
's
Aeroquip
operations
,
which
manufacture
automotive
plastics
,
hoses
and
other
industrial
and
automotive
parts
.

Hoses
and
plastics
together
account
for
about
42
%
of
Trinova
's
total
annual
sales
.

In
a
separate
announcement
,
Trinova
said
the
Aeroquip
group
has
agreed
to
sell
its
spring-brake
,
piston-brake
and
related
businesses
to
Midland
Brake
Inc.
of
Branford
,
Conn
.

Terms
were
n't
disclosed
.

To
provide
for
the
restructuring
's
costs
,
Trinova
said
it
took
an
after-tax
charge
of
$
38.5
million
,
or
$
1.13
a
share
,
in
the
third
quarter
.

The
$
29.7
million
net
loss
compares
with
net
income
of
$
19.6
million
,
or
57
cents
a
share
,
a
year
earlier
.

Sales
rose
8
%
to
$
456.2
million
from
$
422
million

A
group
of
investors
,
including
Giancarlo
Parretti
's
Pathe
Communications
Corp.
and
Sasea
Holding
S.A.
,
have
agreed
to
buy
76.66
%
of
Odeon
Finanziaria
,
a
financially
troubled
Italian
TV
station
.

Florio
Fiorini
,
managing
director
of
Geneva-based
Sasea
,
said
the
investors
would
pay
only
a
symbolic
one
lira
for
the
station
,
``
but
we
have
agreed
to
raise
the
capital
that
will
enable
the
company
to
continue
operating
.

It
's
sort
of
a
Chapter
11
situation
,
''
he
added
,
referring
to
the
U.S.
bankruptcy
law
that
protects
companies
from
creditors
while
they
restructure
.

Milan-based
Odeon
,
which
draws
about
3
%
of
Italian
TV
viewers
,
has
debt
of
250
billion
lire
(
$
181.9
million
)
,
Mr.
Fiorini
said
.

He
added
that
details
of
the
recapitalization
still
have
to
be
worked
out
,
but
that
Pathe
will
take
50
%
of
Odeon
,
Rome
film
producer
Bruno
Lucisano
will
take
10
%
and
the
remaining
16.66
%
,
currently
owned
by
Sasea
,
will
eventually
be
sold
to
other
investors
.

Calisto
Tanzi
,
Odeon
's
owner
,
will
retain
his
23.34
%
stake
.

Italy
's
Supreme
Court
this
year
ordered
Parliament
to
write
a
law
that
will
regulate
media
ownership
.

``
We
think
that
it
's
going
to
be
far
more
favorable
to
own
a
station
before
the
law
is
passed
than
to
try
to
buy
one
afterward
,
''
Mr.
Fiorini
said
.

San
Francisco
area
officials
gave
the
media
high
marks
for
helping
people
find
shelter
and
obtain
emergency
information
after
Tuesday
's
catastrophic
earthquake
.

``
The
press
has
been
doing
an
excellent
job
.

They
are
telling
people
what
roads
are
closed
and
just
keeping
the
public
informed
has
helped
to
keep
the
panic
down
,
''
said
James
Ball
,
a
station
supervisor
at
Daly
City
Police
Department
.

Mr.
Ball
noted
that
television
stations
featured
people
holding
up
phone
books
,
explaining
where
to
call
for
help
.

Radio
stations
provided
an
emergency
number
for
people
who
smelled
gas
but
did
n't
know
how
to
turn
off
their
gas
supply
.

Kim
Schwartz
,
a
spokesperson
for
the
American
Red
Cross
in
Los
Angeles
,
said
television
and
radio
stations
in
San
Francisco
played
a
``
very
positive
role
''
by
providing
the
address
of
28
shelters
of
the
Red
Cross
and
by
giving
out
the
Red
Cross
number
for
contributions
to
help
earthquake
victims
(
1-800-453-9000
)
.

The
San
Francisco
Examiner
issued
a
special
edition
around
noon
yesterday
that
was
filled
entirely
with
earthquake
news
and
information
.

The
Examiner
and
the
San

were
able
to
publish
despite
Tuesday
's
quake
,
which
occurred
close
to

Sterling
Software
Inc.
said
it
lost
its
bid
to
supply
software
services
to
the
National
Aeronautics
and
Space
Administration
's
Ames
Research
Center
at
Moffett
Field
,
Calif
.

Sterling
,
which
estimated
the
value
of
the
contract
at
$
150
million
,
said
NASA
selected
another
bidder
for
final
negotiations
.

In
1988
,
Dallas-based
Sterling
protested
a
similar
decision
by
NASA
involving
the
same
contract
,
claiming
it
had
submitted
the
lowest
bid
.

As
a
result
,
last
March
the
General
Services
Administration
board
of
contract
appeals
directed
NASA
to
reopen
negotiations
on
the
contract
.

Sterling
said
it
had
requested
a
briefing
by
NASA
but
had
not
decided
whether
to
protest
the
agency
's
latest
decision
.

Consolidated
Rail
Corp.
,
New
York
,
reported
that
third-quarter
net
income
climbed
4.8
%
to
$
87
million
,
or
$
1.27
a
share
,
exceeding
analysts
'
expectations
.

In
the
year-earlier
quarter
,
the
freight
railroad
earned
$
83
million
,
or
$
1.21
a
share
.

James
A.
Hagen
,
chairman
and
chief
executive
officer
,
noted
that
earnings
advanced
``
in
the
face
of
a
drop
in
business
,
brought
on
by
the
general
economic
slowdown
.
''

Revenue
slipped
4.6
%
to
$
835
million
from
$
876
million
.

For
the
rest
of
1989
,
Mr.
Hagen
said
,
Conrail
's
traffic
and
revenue
``
will
reflect
the
sluggish
economy
,
but
Conrail
will
continue
to
take
steps
to
control
and
reduce
costs
.
''

For
the
nine
months
,
Conrail
earnings
grew
0.4
%
to
$
229

,
or
$
3.34

from

Georgia
Gulf
Corp.
,
hurt
by
declining
sales
and
falling
chemical

,
said
third-quarter
earnings
fell
13

the
year-earlier
period
.

Sales
declined
10
%
to
$
251.2
million
from
$
278.7
million
.

The
Atlanta-based
chemical
manufacturer
said
lower
prices
hurt
margins
for
most
products
.

``
We
did
see
some
relief
in
raw
material
costs
,
but
it
was
n't
sufficient
to
offset
the
drop
in
sales
prices
,
''
James
R.
Kuse
,
the
company
's
chairman
and
chief
executive
officer
said
in
a
statement
.

On
a
per-share
basis
,
quarterly
earnings
remained
at
$
1.85
,
the
same
as
last
year
,
because
of
the
company
's
share
buy-back
program
.

Georgia
Gulf
had
24.9
million
shares
outstanding
on
average
in
the
quarter

million
in
the
third
quarter
of
1988
,
adjusted
for
a
stock
split
paid
in
January
1989

In
composite
New

,
stock
in

This
temblor-prone
city
dispatched
inspectors
,
firefighters
and
other
earthquake-trained
personnel
to
aid
San
Francisco
.

But
a
secondary
agenda
among
officials
in
the
City
of
Angels
was
to
learn
about
the
disaster-contingency
plans
that
work
and
those
that
do
n't
.

Los
Angeles
Mayor
Tom
Bradley
used
the
opportunity
to
push
the
City
Council
harder
to
pass
a
measure
establishing
a
loss-recovery
reserve
of
$
100
million
.

The
amount
would
help
Los
Angeles
cope
in
the
first
few
weeks
after
its
own
anticipated
quake
,
while
waiting
for
federal
assistance
to
arrive
.

After
San
Francisco
Mayor
Art
Agnos
spoke
on
television
of
the
need
for
building
inspectors
to
check
the
soundness
of
buildings
,
Los
Angeles
dispatched
32
inspectors
to
help
.

And
the
county
of
Los
Angeles
placed
its
firefighters
and
sheriffs
on
alert
,
ready
to
send
in
reinforcements
,
and
alerted
San
Francisco
that
the
city
has
1,000
hospital
beds
at
its
disposal
.

Two
Los
Angeles
radio
stations
initiated
Red
Cross
donation
campaigns
,
and
one
Los
Angeles
bank
manager
forked
over
$
150,000
of
his
own
money
for
relief
purposes
,
the
Red
Cross
said
.

The
Los
Angeles
Red
Cross
sent
2,480
cots
,
500
blankets
,
and
300
pints
of
Type-O
blood
.

It
is
also
pulling
20
people
out
of
Puerto
Rico
,
who
were
helping
Huricane
Hugo
victims
,
and
sending
them
to
San
Francisco
instead
.

The
Arizona
Corporations
Commission
authorized
an
11.5
%
rate
increase
at
Tucson
Electric
Power
Co.
,
substantially
lower
than
recommended
last
month
by
a
commission
hearing
officer
and
barely
half
the
rise
sought
by
the
utility
.

The
ruling
follows
a
host
of
problems
at
Tucson
Electric
,
including
major
write-downs
,
a
60
%
slash
in
the
common
stock
dividend
and
the
departure
of
former
Chairman
Einar
Greve
during
a
company
investigation
of
his
stock
sales
.

The
Arizona
regulatory
ruling
calls
for
$
42
million
in
added
revenue
yearly
,
compared
with
a
$
57
million
boost
proposed
by
the
commission
hearing
officer
.

The
company
had
sought
increases
totaling
$
80.3
million
,
or
22
%
.

The
decision
was
announced
after
trading
ended

A
Tucson
Electric
spokesman

the

was
disappointed
by

commission

decision
and
``
concerned
about
the
financial
integrity
of

South
Korean
President
Roh
Tae
Woo
,
brushing
aside
suggestions
that
the
won
be
revalued
again
,
said
the
currency
's
current
level
against
the
dollar
is
``
appropriate
.
''

His
comments
,
made
in
response
to
reporters
'
questions
at
the
National
Press
Club
here
,
signaled
that
Seoul
is
resisting
U.S.
pressure
for
a
further
rise
in
the
currency
's
value
.

The
U.S.
wants
a
higher
won
to
make
South
Korea
's
exports
more
expensive
and
help
trim
Seoul
's
trade
surplus
.

Many
South
Korean
business
people
want
a
devaluation
instead
,
arguing
that
the
won
's
recent
gains
already
have
weakened
the
country
's
export
performance
.

Mr.
Roh
also
said
South
Korea
is
taking
steps
that
would
free
the
won
to
respond
to
market
forces
.

Seoul
has
pointed
to
its
lack
of
a
foreign
exchange
market
as
one
reason
the
won
's
value
remains
heavily
controlled
.

Mr.
Roh
said
a
U.S.
demand
for
the
removal
of
South
Korean
import
quotas
on
beef
will
be
resolved
``
satisfactorily
''
but
gave
no
hint
when
that
will
happen
.

Speaking
to
a
joint
meeting
of
Congress
earlier
,
he
said
South
Korea
ca
n't
move
quickly
on
such
agricultural
trade
issues
``
without
causing
political
and
social
trauma
.

Great
American
Bank
said
its
board
approved
the
formation
of
a
holding
company
enabling
the
savings
bank
to
pursue
nontraditional
banking
activities
under
a
new
federal
law
.

The
proposed
holding
company
's
primary
purpose
would
be
to
allow
Great
American
to
continue
engaging
in
real
estate
development
activities
,
it
said
.

Those
activities
generated
$
26.1
million
in
operating
profit
last
year
.

But
according
to
Great
American
,
such
profits
do
n't
count
toward
meeting
the
San
Diego
savings
bank
's
new
capitalization
requirements
under
1989
federal
law
.

The
new
real
estate
unit
would
have
a
separate
capital
structure
to
comply
with
the
law
.

The
proposed
holding
company
would
also
consolidate
Great
American
Bank
in
San
Diego
and
its
Tucson
,
Ariz.
,
savings
bank
into
a
single
,
federally
chartered
institution
in
San
Diego
.

The
consolidation
is
expected
to
save
$
1
million
a
year
in
administrative
costs
,
a
Great
American
spokesman
said
.

Dale
Lang
,
who
this
week
completed
the
acquisition
of
the
publisher
of
Ms.
and
Sassy
,
is
candid
about
the
challenge
he
is
taking
on
.

Mr.
Lang
admits
that
Ms.
is
``
in
dire
straits
''
and
that
Sassy
needs
big
promotional
dollars
to
keep
it
alive
.

But
the
57-year-old
publisher
has
moved
quickly
and
boldly
to
deal
with
the
magazines
'
problems
.

Last
Friday
,
he
told
the
staff
of
Ms.
that
the
magazine
in
January
would
begin
publishing
without
advertising
.

Mr.
Lang
will
do
away
with
expensive
circulation
drives
,
not
to
mention
sales
staff
,
and
attempt
to
publish
the
17-year-old
magazine
supported
by
circulation
revenue
alone
.

``
Any
fool
can
publish
a
money-losing
magazine
.

I
want
to
publish
one
that
succeeds
,
''
said
Mr.
Lang
.

``
For
Ms.
,
it
's
time
to
publish
for
the
reader
,
not
the
advertiser
.
''

As
for
Sassy
,
which
competes
directly
with
News
Corp.
's
Seventeen
magazine
,
Mr.
Lang
says
that
in
the
next
two
years
he
will
spend
$
6
million
promoting
and
improving
the
magazine
.

Though
Sassy
has
grown
quickly
since
its
debut
in
March
1988
,
it
has
been
the
target
of
conservative
lobbyists
and
skittish
advertisers
who
bristled
at
its
frank
editorial
matter
on
teen-age
problems
.

Mr.
Lang
said
the
former
Australian
owners
of
Sassy
were
``
blind-sided
by
the
Moral
Majority
...
.

Their
reaction
was
to
do
nothing
and
ride
it
out
.
''

He
said
Sassy
will
keep
its
irreverent
tone
,
but
added
,
``
We
will
keep
a
close
watch
on
the
editorial
content
of
the
magazine
.
''

Sassy
already
has
recovered
;
circulation
has
quickly
passed
the
500,000
mark
and
advertising
pages
have
stabilized
this
year
at
more
than
300
.

What
's
more
,
Mr.
Lang
says
he
has
what
all
publishers
wish
for
:
a
bona
fide
niche
.

``
Seventeen
is
written
more
for
mothers
,
not
their
daughters
,
''
said
Mr.
Lang
.

``
But
Sassy
has
a
different
spirit
.

It
gets
more
mail
in
a
month
than
McCall
's
got
in
a
year
,
and
it
's
not
from
mothers
.

I
feel
about
Sassy
like
I
did
about
Working
Woman
10
years
ago
.
''

Mr.
Lang
took
on
Ms.
and
Sassy
with
the
acquisition
of
Matilda
Publications
Inc.
by
his
newly
formed
Lang
Communications
.

Lang
owns
70
%
of
Matilda
,
while
Citicorp
owns
the
rest
through
its
Citicorp
Venture
Capital
Partners
.

Two
weeks
ago
,
Citicorp
and
Mr.
Lang
pumped
$
800,000
into
Matilda
just
to
keep
the
doors
open
.

Industry
observers
have
congratulated
Mr.
Lang
on
what
some
call
his
``
courageous
''
handling
of
Ms.
,
but
his
track
record
in
magazine
publishing
in
general
has
gotten
mixed
reviews
.

Besides
Ms.
and
Sassy
,
closely
held
Lang
Communications
includes
Success
,
a
magazine
for
entrepreneurs
and
small
businesses
,
and
Working
Woman
and
Working
Mother
,
two
monthly
magazines
.

Working
Woman
,
with
circulation
near
one
million
,
and
Working
Mother
,
with
625,000
circulation
,
are
legitimate
magazine
success
stories
.

The
magazine
Success
,
however
,
was
for
years
lackluster
and
unfocused
.

Only
recently
has
it
been
attractively
redesigned
and
its
editorial
product
improved
.

Success
is
expected
to
gain
at
least
because
of
the
recent
folding
of
rival
Venture
,
another
magazine
for
growing
companies
.

Working
Woman
and
Working
Mother
have
operated
as
part
of
Working
Woman\/McCall
's
Group
,
a
less-than-successful
joint
venture
between
Mr.
Lang
and
Time
Warner
Inc
.

The
joint
venture
is
being
undone
,
with
McCall
's
magazine
being
sold
last
summer
to
the
New
York
Times
Co.
's
Magazine
Group
for
about
$
80
million
,
and
Time
Warner
agreeing
to
sell
back
its
50
%
interest
in
Working
Woman
and
Working
Mother
to
Mr.
Lang
.

Executives
at
Time
Inc
.
Magazine
Co.
,
a
subsidiary
of
Time
Warner
,
have
said
the
joint
venture
with
Mr.
Lang
was
n't
a
good
one
.

The
venture
,
formed
in
1986
,
was
supposed
to
be
Time
's
low-cost
,
safe
entry
into
women
's
magazines
.

Mr.
Lang
surprised
Time
soon
after
joining
forces
when
he
said
he
would
negotiate
rates
individually
with
advertisers
,
a
practice
common
in
broadcasting
but
considered
taboo
by
magazine
publishers
.

In
addition
,
McCall
's
put
in
a
less
than
stellar
performance
.

Until
a
recent
comeback
,
it
saw
steep
losses
in
ad
pages
and
circulation
.

Time
executives
complained
about
the
shoddy
editorial
quality
,
and
in
the
end
,
one
Time
executive
who
asked
not
to
be
identified
said
,
``
Frankly
,
McCall
's
and
the
joint
venture
were
an
embarrassment
.
''

Mr.
Lang
feels
that
Time
's
priorities
changed
.

``
Their
management
changed
right
after
{
the
venture
was
formed
}
,
and
I
do
n't
think
they
were
comfortable
getting
into
the
competitive
wars
of
women
's
service
magazines
.
''

Today
,
Mr.
Lang
believes
his
magazines
will
offer
what
many
women
's
magazines
do
n't
.

``
We
write
straight
for
women
on
their
level
,
''
he
said
.

``
We
do
n't
have
passive
readers
.
''

Mr.
Lang
points
out
that
even
Success
,
in
part
,
fits
the
company
's
image
,
since
about
30
%
of
its
readership
is
female
.

Mr.
Lang
has
named
Carol
Taber
,
43
,
as
group
publisher
of
New
York-based
Lang
Communications
.

She
will
oversee
Working
Woman
,
Working
Mother
and
Success
magazines
,
and
retain
her
post
as
publisher
of
Working
Woman
.

The
sale
price
of
McCall
's
--
twice
what
Mr.
Lang
originally
paid
for
it
--
will
finance
Lang
Communications
'
buy-back
of
Time
Warner
's
50
%
interest
in
Working
Woman
and
Working
Mother
.

Mr.
Lang
says
he
is
n't
scouting
new
acquisitions
,
at
least
for
now
.

``
We
would
have
to
go
outside
to
banks
to
get
the
money
and
I
am
not
ready
to
do
that
,
''
he
said
.

``
Besides
,
we
have
enough
on
our
plate
.

There
is
plenty
of
work
to
be
done
on
what
we
have
.

Britain
's
Monopolies
and
Mergers
Commission
Wednesday
cleared
Rhone-Poulenc
S.A.
's
purchase
of
a
specialty
bulk-chemical
unit
from
Monsanto
Co.
,
saying
the
purchase
was
unlikely
to
have
any
lasting
impact
on
U.K.
industrial
consumers
.

The
commission
,
which
was
asked
to
study
the
deal
by
the
Department
of
Trade
and
Industry
after
its
announcement
in
February
,
said
the
diversity
of
global
supply
of
chemicals
used
in
making
analgesic
drugs
was
great
enough
to
offset
the
dominant
U.K.
market
share
Rhone-Poulenc
would
gain
through
the
acquisition
.

The
French
chemical
giant
would
hold
an
80
%
share
of
the
U.K.
market
for
salicylic
acid
,
methyl
salicylate
and
bulk
aspirin
.

The
commission
found
that
if
the
British
government
attempted
to
block
the
merger
,
Rhone-Poulenc
would
likely
respond
by
closing
the
salicylates
plant
Monsanto
operates
in
Wales
,
removing
the
matter
from
U.K.
jurisdiction
.

Morrison
Knudsen
Corp.
posted
third-quarter
net
income
of
$
7.9
million
,
or
69
cents
a
share
,
continuing
a
rebound
from
steep
year-ago
losses
.

In
the
third
quarter
a
year-earlier
,
the
construction
and
engineering
concern
posted
a
loss
of
$
51.2
million
,
or
$
4.68
a
share
.

Revenue
in
the
latest
quarter
rose
14
%
to
$
589
million
from
$
515.1
million
.

In
composite
trading
on
the
New
York
Stock
Exchange
,
Morrison
gained
$
2.25
to
$
44.125
.

Morrison
said
the
engineering
and
construction
segment
performed
well
,
with
the
mining
and
MK-Ferguson
operations
making
important
contributions
.

Boise
,
Idaho-based
Morrison
had
losses
totaling
$
186
million
over
the
two
years
ended
in
December
,
but
it
has
surged
back
to
profitability
as
a
result
of
cost-cutting
and
shedding
of
unprofitable
operations
.

In
the
nine
months
,
the
company
's
net
income
was
$
21.5
million
,
or
$
1.88
a
share
,
compared
with
a
year-earlier
loss
of
$
97.8
million
,
or
$
8.96
a
share
.

Revenue
rose
17

to

from

The
House
Ethics
Committee
officially
cited
Rep.
Jim
Bates
(
D.
,
Calif
.
)
for
sexually
harassing
two
female
employees
,
but
did
n't
recommend
formal
disciplinary
action
.

Rep.
Bates
said
he
accepted
the
finding
,
but
one
of
the
victims
,
Dorena
Bertussi
,
denounced
the
ethics
panel
's
action
as
``
absurd
.
''

Acting
more
than
a
year
after
Ms.
Bertussi
filed
a
complaint
,
the
panel
issued
a
``
letter
of
reproval
''
saying
Rep.
Bates
had
admitted
conduct
that
violated
a
House
rule
forbidding
discrimination
against
employees
on
account
of
their
sex
.

It
ordered
Rep.
Bates
to
write
letters
of
apology
to
Ms.
Bertussi
and
to
a
second
complainant
,
Karen
Dryden
.

Rep.
Bates
said
he
would
write
the
letters
as
ordered
.

``
I
accept
the
resolution
of
the
matter
by
the
Ethics
Committee
,
''
he
said
.

The
panel
also
warned
Rep.
Bates
that
any
further
violations
``
may
result
in
a
recommendation
that
disciplinary
action
be
considered
.
''

But
Ms.
Bertussi
asked
,
``
Who
in
their
right
mind
is
going
to
file
another
complaint
with
the
Ethics
Committee
?
''

Rep.
Bates
has
publicly
begged
for
forgiveness
from
voters
and
was
re-elected
with
60
%
of
the
vote
last
November
.

Mesa
Airlines
said
the
takeover
offer
it
received
earlier
this
week
from
StatesWest
Airlines
is
for
a
combination
of
cash
and
securities
valued
by
StatesWest
at
$
10
a
Mesa
share
.

Both
companies
are
regional
carriers
in
the
Southwest
.

When
it
made
the
offer
,
StatesWest
declined
to
disclose
details
and
asked
Mesa
to
do
the
same
.

But
Farmington
,
N.M.-based
Mesa
said
the
offer
was
for
$
7
in
cash
and
unspecified
StatesWest
securities
valued
at
$
3
a
share
.

Based
on
the
number
of
Mesa
shares
outstanding
not
already
owned
by
StatesWest
,
the
proposed
takeover
would
have
a
value
of
about
$
15.3
million
.

StatesWest
owns
7.25
%
of
Mesa
.

Last
week
,
Mesa
rejected
a
general
proposal
from
StatesWest
that
the
two
carriers
combine
.

In
response
to
the
specific
offer
,
Gary
Risley
,
Mesa
vice
president
,
said
management
will
ask
directors
to
employ
a
financial
consultant
to
advise
them
.

Fleet\/Norstar
Financial
Group
reported
a
12
%
increase
in
net
income
in
the
third
quarter
,
led
by
a
43
%
gain
in
its

group
.

Fleet

net
was
$

a
primary

,
compared
with
$
85.8

The
Providence

group
,
which
includes
commercial-credit

operations
,
contributed
$
30.6
million
to
net
,
up
from
last

's
$

.

Fleet
also
noted
that
,
unlike
other
banking
companies
in
the
Northeast
,
it
has
been
only
marginally
hurt
by
nonperforming
loans
that
have
resulted
from
the
slumping

Benj

Franklin
Federal
Savings
&
Loan
Association
said
it
expects
to
post
a
third-quarter
net
loss
of
about
$
8
million
,
or
$
1.04
a
share
,
as
a
result
of
adding
$
11
million
in
loan-loss
reserves
.

The
Portland
,
Ore.
,
thrift
,
which
has
$
5.2
billion
of
assets
,
had
net
income
in
last
year
's
third
quarter
of
$
1.8
million
,
or
23
cents
a
share
.

Franklin
said
it
expects
to
report
earnings
for
the
latest
quarter
next
week
.

The
additional
reserves
relate
to
possible
write-downs
of
certain
assets
held
by
Franklin
and
its
subsidiaries
and
the
default
of
a
bond
in
its
investment
portfolio
,
the
thrift
said
.

According
to
a
spokeswoman
,
they
also
relate
to
changes
Franklin
will
have
to
make
in
its
accounting
procedures
to
comply
with
new
federal
capitalization
requirements
for
thrifts
.

The

Arkla
Inc.
said
that
as
part
of
a
program
to
improve
profitability
it
will
take
a
total
of
$
189
million
in
after-tax
charges
by
year
end
.

It
also
announced
an
initial
public
offering
of
18
%
of
its
gas
exploration
and
production
subsidiary
.

The
Shreveport
,
La.
,
natural
gas
company
said
the
charges
,
though
partially
offset
by
a
one-time
gain
from
the
offering
,
will
result
in
a
full-year
after-tax
loss
.

Last
year
,
the
company
had
net
income
of
$
117.3
million
,
or
$
1.30
a
share
.

Arkla
said
it
will
report
$
179
milllion
in
one-time
charges
against
continuing
operations
for
the
third
quarter
,
reflecting
settlement
of
certain
natural
gas
contracts
.

It
said
it
will
take
a
$
10
million
fourth-quarter
charge
against
discontinued
operations
,
reflecting
certain
write-downs
and
the
planned
sale
of
a
unit
.

Arkla
said
its
initial
offering
of
18
%
of
Arkla
Exploration
Co.
is
expected
to
result
in
a
net
gain
of
about
$
90
million
,
which
will
be
used
to
pay
down
Arkla
debt
.

Arkla
Exploration
owns
sizable
gas
and

reserves
in

South
Africa
negotiated
a
new
debt
agreement
with
its
major
foreign
creditors
for
about
$
8
billion
of
its
foreign
debt
outstanding
,
said
Chris
Stals
,
governor
of
the
Reserve
Bank
and
the
country
's
chief
debt
negotiator
.

The
new
agreement
will
last
for
3
1\/2
years
starting
July
1
,
1990
,
when
the
current
agreement
expires
.

The
announcement
coincides
with
the
start
of
the
Commonwealth
Ministers
Conference
in
Kuala
Lumpur
,
where
proposals
for
renewed
sanctions
against
South
Africa
,
including
moves
to
block
settling
of
a
new
debt
agreement
,
were
scheduled
to
be
discussed
.

As
with
the
previous
pact
,
the
new
agreement
covers
the
country
's
debt
``
inside
the
net
,
''
which
applies
mainly
to
repayments
due
to
overseas
creditor
banks
by
the
private
sector
.

The
agreement
calls
for
South
African
debtors
to
make
repayments
in
eight
installments
,
starting
in
December
of
next
year
.

The
redemption
then
would
be
at
1.5
%
of
the
total
debt
,
increasing
to
2.5
%
in
February
1991
,
and
to
3
%
at
six-month
intervals
thereafter
.

A
revised
provision
would
be
included
for
the
conversion
of
short-term
claims
inside
the
net
to
long-term
loans
outside
the
net
.

These
claims
would
be
repayable
over
a
10-year
period
.

Foreign
debt
falling
outside
the
net
of
affected
indebtedness
--
which
Mr.
Stahl
estimated
at
$
12
billion
--
would
remain
not
subject
to
the
debt
arrangements
.

New
York
Times
Co.
said
net
income
rose
in
the
third
quarter
because
of
a
one-time
gain
on
the
sale
of
the
company
's
cable-TV
system
.

Net
surged
to
$
210.8
million
,
or
$
2.68
a
share
,
from
$
26.7
million
,
or
33
cents
a
share
,
a
year
earlier
.

The
latest
quarter
included
a
gain
of
$
193.3
million
,
or
$
2.46
a
share
,
from
the
sale
of
New
York
Times
Cable
,
completed
in
August
.

Exclusive
of
the
gain
,
operating
profit
declined
35
%
to
$
16.4
million
,
or
21
cents
a
share
,
from
$
25.2
million
,
or
31
cents
a
share
.

The
decline
primarily
reflected
the
dilution
from
acquiring
McCall
's
,
Golf
World
(
U.S.
)
and
Sailing
World
magazines
;
lower
equity
earnings
from
the
forest-products
group
because
of
price
discounting
and
an
unfavorable
exchange
rate
,
and
an
8.7
%
decline
in
advertising
linage
at
the
New
York
Times
,
the
company
's
flagship
newspaper
.

Advertising
volume
at
the
company
's
35
regional
newspapers
decreased
1.1
%
.

The
company
said
the
negative
factors
are
expected
to
continue
into
next
year
.

Revenue
rose
6.4
%
to
$
415.3
million
from
$
390.5

Democrat
Gene
Taylor
won
a
special
election
to
fill
the
congressional
seat
vacated
by
the
death
of
Republican
Larkin
Smith
,
taking
back
the
GOP
's
lone
redoubt
in
Mississippi
's
House
delegation
.

Mr.
Taylor
's
overwhelming
victory
against
Republican
Tom
Anderson
reclaims
a
seat
the
Republicans
had
held
for
17
years
and
gives
the
Democrats
their
fifth
victory
in
the
seven
special
House
elections
held
this
year
.

Mr.
Taylor
,
a
36-year-old
state
senator
from
Bay
St.

,
won
65
%
of
the
vote
in
a
district
that
has

Could
the
collapse
of
I-880
have
been
prevented
?

That
was
the
question
structural
engineers
and
California
transportation
officials
were
asking
themselves
yesterday
as
rescue
workers
began
the
gruesome
task
of
trying
to
extract
as
many
as
250
victims
from
beneath
the
concrete
slabs
of
the
double-deck
Nimitz
Freeway
in
Oakland
that
caved
in
during
Tuesday
's
temblor
.

After
touring
the
area
,
California
Gov.
George
Deukmejian
late
yesterday
called
for
an
inquiry
into
the
freeway
's
collapse
,
blaming
the
disaster
on
substandard
construction
,
the
Associated
Press
reported
.

The
impact
of
the
destruction
of
this
2.5-mile
stretch
of
highway
was
tragically
measured
in
lost
lives
.

But
there
are
other
long-term
effects
that
raise
serious
questions
about
the
ability
of
California
's
infrastructure
to
withstand
a
major
temblor
.

It
could
easily
be
two
years
before
the
well-traveled
artery
that
helps
connect
Oakland
with
San
Francisco
is
reopened
,
and
the
cost
to
build
a
new
stretch
of
highway
could
soar
to
more
than
$
250
million
,
said
Charles
J.
O'Connell
,
deputy
district
director
in
Los
Angeles
of
the
California
Department
of
Transportation
,
nicknamed
Caltrans
.

Caltrans
in
Sacramento
said
total
damage
from
the
collapsed
highway
is
estimated
at
around
$
500
million
.

The
aftershocks
of
the
highway
tragedy
are
reverberating
in
Los
Angeles
as
well
,
as
local
politicians
spoke
yesterday
against
plans
to
bring
double-decking
to
Los
Angeles
freeways
by
1994
.

Caltrans
plans
to
add
a
second
deck
for
buses
and
car
pools
above
the
median
of
a
2.5-mile
stretch
of
the
Harbor
Freeway
just
south
of
Los
Angeles
,
near
the
Memorial
Coliseum
.

Los
Angeles
County
Supervisor
Kenneth
Hahn
yesterday
vowed
to
fight
the
introduction
of
double-decking
in
the
area
.

Caltrans
abandoned
double-decking
in
the
early
1970s
,
following
the
1971
Sylmar
earthquake
that
destroyed
freeway
sections
just
north
of
Los
Angeles
,
Mr.
O'Connell
explained
.

That
temblor
measured
6.1
on
the
Richter
scale
;
Tuesday
's
was

So
why
even
consider
stacking
freeways
now
?

``
We
've
run
out
of
places
to
build
freeways
in
L.A.
,
and
the
only
place
to
go
is
up
,
''
Mr.
O'Connell
said
,
although
he
acknowledges
there
are
many
obstacles
,
including
cost
.

But
as
for
safety
,
he
says
double-deck
freeways
built
today
with
the
heavily
reinforced
concrete
and
thicker
columns
required
after
the
Sylmar
quake
should
withstand
a
calamitous
temblor
of
7.5
to
8
on
the
Richter
scale
.

Reasons
for
the
collapse
of
the
Nimitz
Freeway
were
sketchy
yesterday
.

But
most
structural
engineers
attributed
the
destruction
to
improper
reinforcement
of
the
columns
that
supported
the
decks
,
and
the
fact
that
the
ground
beneath
the
highway
is
largely
landfill
and
can
become
unstable
,
or
``
liquefy
,
''
in
a
major
quake
.

The
two-story
roadway
,
designed
in
the
mid-1940s
and
completed
in
1957
,
was
supported
by
columns
that
apparently
lacked
the
kind
of
steel
reinforcement
used
in
highways
today
.

While
the
pillars
did
have
long
metal
bars
running
vertically
through
them
for
reinforcement
,
they
apparently
lacked
an
adequate
number
of
metal
``
ties
''
that
run
horizontally
through
the
column
,
said
Leo
Parker
,
a
structural
engineer
in
Los
Angeles
.

Caltrans
today
uses
a
variation
of
the
design
Mr.
Parker
describes
,
with
spiraling
steel
rods
inside
.

But
in
the
case
of
the
Nimitz
Freeway
,
the
lack
of
such
support
caused
the
core
of
the
columns
to
crumble
and
buckle
under
the
weight
of
the
second
deck
,
crushing
motorists
who
were
lined
up
in
bumper-to-bumper
rush-hour
traffic
on
the
lower
deck
nearly
15
feet
below
.

Officials
of
the
state
agency
did
n't
have
any
immediate
explanation
why
the
reinforcement
did
n't
hold
up
.

Caltrans
reinforced
the
highway
in
1977
as
part
of
a
$
55
million
statewide
project
,
using
steel
cables
to
tie
the
decks
of
the
freeway
to
the
columns
and
prevent
the
structure
from
swaying
in
a
quake
.

Caltrans
spokesman
Jim
Drago
in
Sacramento
declined
to
identify
the
engineering
firm
that
did
the
reinforcement
work
.

Liability
in
the
bridge
and
road
collapses
will
revolve
around
whether
government
took
``
reasonable
care
''
to
build
and
maintain
the
structures
,
says
John
Messina
,
a
Tacoma
,
Wash.
,
personal-injury
attorney
who
specializes
in
highway
design
and
maintenance
cases
.

The
firm
brought
in
to
strengthen
the
structure
could
be
liable
as
well
.

The
results
of
the
quake
certainly
raise
questions
about
whether
reasonable
care
was
taken
,
Mr.
Messina
says
.

Given
the
seismic
history
of
the
Bay
Area
,
``
it
seems
to
me
that
a
6.9
earthquake
is
a
foreseeable
event
.
''

Caltrans
'
Mr.
Drago
defended
the
agency
's
work
on
the
Nimitz
Freeway
.

``
The
work
was
done
properly
,
''
he
said
.

``
Basically
,
we
had
a
severe
earthquake
of
significant
duration
and
it
was
just
something
the
structure
could
n't
withstand
.
''

Ironically
,
Caltrans
this
year
began
working
on
a
second
round
of
seismic
reinforcements
of
freeways
around
the
state
,
this
time
wrapping
freeway
columns
in
``
steel
blankets
''
to
reinforce
them
.

But
only
bridges
supported
with
single
rows
of
columns
were
top
priority
,
and
the
Nimitz
Freeway
,
supported
by
double
rows
,
was
left
out
,
Mr.
Drago
explained
.

``
The
reason
is
that
the
technology
is
such
that
we
're
not
able
to
retrofit
multi-column
structures
,
''
he
said
.

Lionel
Corp.

board
unanimously
rejected

offer
of
$
8
a
share
,
or
$
95.4
million
,
for
as
much
as
90
%
of
Lionel
by
a
group
with
a
9.9
%
stake
in
the
toy
retailer
.

Lionel
also
urged
holders
of
its
stock
and
debt
not
to
tender
their
securities
,
saying
it
wants
to
remain
independent
to
pursue
its
business
strategy
.

Lionel
also
said
the
offer
by
Robert
I.
Toussie
Limited
Partnership
is
inadequate
,
and
full
of
conditions
that
leave
it
``
subject
to
substantial
uncertainty
.
''

In
addition
,
Lionel
began
a
lawsuit
in
federal
District
Court
in
New
York
seeking
to
enjoin
the
offer
,
alleging
,
among
other
things
,
violations
of
federal
securities
law
and
fraudulent
manipulation
of
the
market
for
Lionel
's
securities
.

Robert
I.
Toussie
,
general
partner
of
the
investment
group
,
said
the
Lionel
response
reflected
management
's
entrenched
position
,
saying
officials
had
failed
to
come
up
with
a
better
alternative
to
his
group
's
offer
.

Mr.
Toussie
said
he
would
respond
to
Lionel
's
suit
after
his
lawyers
review
it
.

Efforts
by
a
federal
mediator
to
reignite
talks
between
Boeing
Co.
and
the
Machinists
union
apparently
failed
,
and
no
further
meetings
are
scheduled
.

Company
officials
and
union
representatives
did
n't
meet
face
to
face
,
but
the
mediator
shuttled
between
the
two
groups
.

In
a
statement
issued
after
the
meeting
,
the
aerospace
giant
said
it
wo
n't
increase
its
offer
although
adjustments
within
the
proposed
pay-and-benefit
mix
are
possible
.

Machinists
already
have
rejected
a
proposal
that
called
for
a
4
%
pay
increase
and
8
%
bonus
in
the
first
year
.

In
the
second
year
,
workers
would
receive
a
3
%
wage
boost
and
a
3
%
bonus
,
followed
by
a
3
%
increase
without
a
bonus
in
the
third
year
.

``
The
company
will
not
budge
on
anything
,
''
said
a
spokesman
for
the
union
.

As
the
strike
enters
its
15th
day
today
,
some
members
are
getting
nervous
,
the
spokesman
conceded
,
but
the
majority
of
the
55,000
Machinists
are
prepared
to
``
wait
it
out
as
long
as
it
takes
.

United
Merchants
&
Manufacturers
Inc.
said
its
president
,
Uzi
Ruskin
,
withdrew
his
proposal
to
acquire
control
of
the
New
York
textile
and
clothing
company
.

Last
month
,
Mr.
Ruskin
proposed
,
among
other
things
,
to
buy
3.5
million
shares
,
or
38
%
,
for
$
4
apiece
.

Coupled
with
his
current
1.2
million
shares
and
4
%
held
by
an
associate
,
the
stake
would
have
given
him
control
of
55
%
of
the
concern
.

In
a
Securities
and
Exchange
Commission
filing
,
Mr.
Ruskin
had
said
that
holders
of
the
other
45
%
of
United
Merchants
would
receive
one-half
share
of
a
new
preferred
stock
for
each
of
their
shares
.

A
special
committee
of
United
Merchants
directors
said
that
in
view
of
uncertainties
regarding
various
legal
and
financial
considerations
,
it
could
n't
recommend
the
plan
to
the
full
board
.

The
company
is
exploring
,
with
a
major
financial
institution
,
the
development
of
a
plan
to
boost
the
value
of
the
company
for
its
holders
,
Mr.
Ruskin
said
.

In
a
separate
SEC
filing
,
Albert
Safer
,
who
holds
6.46

of

,
said
he
retained

Lazard
Freres
&
Co.
for
advice
as
he
evaluates
the
possibility
of
making
a
bid
for
the
textile
maker
.

On

,
Mr.

,
a

The
White
House
is
making
sure
nobody
will
accuse
it
of
taking
this
crisis
lightly
.

In
the
aftermath
of
the
California
earthquake
,
President
Bush
and
his
aides
flew
into
a
whirlwind
of
earthquake-related
activity
yesterday
morning
.

Some
of
it
was
necessary
to
get
federal
help
flowing
to
victims
,
but
some
seemed
designed
mostly
to
project
an
image
of
a
White
House
in
action
.

Mr.
Bush
and
his
aides
were
accused
of
responding
too
slowly
after
the
Exxon
Valdez
oil
tanker
split
open
in
Alaskan
waters
and
Hurricane
Hugo
struck
the
Carolina
coast
,
and
they
clearly
do
n't
want
a
repeat
of
those
charges
now
.

So
the
White
House
announced
that
Mr.
Bush
got
his
first
earthquake
briefing
of
the
day
at
6:30
a.m.
from
chief
of
staff
John
Sununu
.

By
noon
,
Mr.
Bush
had
taken
two
phone
calls
from
Vice
President
Dan
Quayle
,
who
was
in
California
;
made
a
televised
statement
of
concern
;
signed
a
disaster
proclamation
;
received
a
written
report
from
the
Federal
Emergency
Management
Agency
;
and
visited
FEMA
headquarters
.

Mr.
Bush
himself
essentially
acknowledged
that
he
and
his
aides
were
trying
to
head
off
criticism
.

On
his
FEMA
visit
,
Mr.
Bush
said
that
he
hoped
there
would
be
``
less
carping
''
about
the
emergency
office
's
performance
this
time
,
adding
that
the
agency
``
took
a
hit
''
for
its
reaction
to
Hurricane
Hugo
.

The
White
House
already
is
talking
of
Mr.
Bush
visiting
the
California
earthquake
site
this
weekend
.

He
visited
the
Hugo
devastation
but
not
until
after
local
leaders
urged
him
to
do
so
.

Beazer
PLC
,
a
major
British
building
materials
and
construction
concern
,
reported
a
24
%
jump
in
pretax
profit
for
its
latest
financial
year
,
helped
largely
by
contributions
from
its
U.S.
unit
,
Koppers
Co
.

Pretax
profit
for
the
year
to
June
30
rose
to
#
142.5
million
(
$
224.5
million
)
from
#
114.7
million
(
$
180.7
million
)
,
broadly
matching
analysts
'
expectations
.

Profit
after
taxes
and
minority
interests
but
before
extraordinary
items
increased
22
%
to
#
92.6
million
from
#
75.6
million
a
year
earlier
,
while
fully
diluted
earnings
per
share
rose
to
29.90
pence
(
47
cents
)
from
24.68
pence
(
39
cents
)
.

The
lethal
shudders
that
wracked
the
San
Francisco
Bay
Area
--
rated
a
6.9
on
the
Richter
scale
--
did
n't
match
the
great
earthquake
of
1906
,
rated
at
8.25
.

The
difference
of
just
1.35
points
on
the
scale
,
designed
by
Charles
Richter
of
CalTech
in
the
1930s
,
means
the
older
quake
was
``
10
to
20
times
stronger
,
''
says
Lane
Johnson
,
director
of
the
University
of
California
Berkeley
Seismographic
Station
.

The
ground
ruptured
along
a
20-to-30-mile
stretch
of
the
San
Andreas
Fault
on
Tuesday
,
Mr.
Johnson
added
.

In
1906
,
the
rupture
was
300
miles
long
and
a
couple
feet
wide
.

Though
the
epicenter
of
Tuesday
's
temblor
was
located
10
miles
north
of
the
town
of
Santa
Cruz
,
and
50
miles
south
of
San
Francisco
,
its
havoc
hopscotched
up
the
coast
in
seemingly
random
fashion
.

But
the
greatest
damage
was
visited
on
buildings
and
roadways
perched
upon
landfill
,
as
were
the
Marina
District
of
San
Francisco
and
the
Bay
Bridge
--
two
areas
of
maximum
devastation
.

``
Landfill
--
loose
and
unconsolidated
earth
--
may
feel
like
rock
but
it
behaves
like
liquid
when
you
shake
it
,
''
said
Douglas
Segar
,
professor
of
geosciences
at
San
Francisco
State
University
in
a
televised
interview
.

``
It
liquefies
in
a
patchwork
quilt
pattern
.

Our
quake
behaved
much
like
the
Mexico
City
earthquake
,
where
great
damage
was
miles
from
the
epicenter
.
''

Mr.
Johnson
,
of
the
Berkeley
seismographic
station
,
said
:
``
Landfill
can
be
done
if
it
's
properly
compacted
.

You
can
drive
piles
on
it
and
build
on
it
.
''

He
cited
the
example
of
San
Francisco
's
financial
district
,
where
many
new
glass
towers
survived
almost
unscathed
.

But
the
public
policy
issues
raised
by
earthquake
damage
will
be
difficult
to
address
,
Mr.
Johnson
predicted
.

``
The
attention
span
of
the
public
is
short
,
''
he
said
.

``
We
've
known
for
years
and
years
we
've
got
lots
of
old
{
pre-1950s
}
unreinforced
brick
and
masonry
buildings
.
''

One
old
building
,
the
Golden
State
Bank
Building
on
Front
Street
,
had
its
yellow
brick
facade
sheared
off
by
the
shock
of
the
quake
,
leaving
a
wedge
of
its
third
floor
open
to
the
air
,
while
piles
of
dusty
bricks
tumbled
to
the
street
below
narrowly
missing
rush-hour
pedestrians
and
cars
.

Reinforcing
such
old
building
stock
,
Mr.
Johnson
said
,
``
comes
down
to
money
.

It
's
a
danger
.

We
know
it
's
there
.

And
sooner
or
later
,
we
have
to
do
something
about
it
.
''

The
urgency
is
heightened
because
this
week
's
earthquake
--
while
major
and
followed
by
hundreds
of
aftershocks
--
did
n't
release
enough
pent-up
energy
tension
along
the
faultlines
to
preclude
more
and
bigger
quakes
soon
.

``
The
big
one
is
still
due
,
''
Mr.
Johnson
predicted
in
an
interview
.

``
The
Bay
Area
has
three
very
dangerous
faults
,
the
San
Andreas
,
the
Hayward
fault
and
the
Calaveras
fault
.

It
{
Tuesday
's
quake
}
has
n't
solved
our
problem
.

In
California
,
this
is
the
reality
.

Coca-Cola
Co.
may
be
about
to
intensify
the
cola
wars
.

Coke
said
it
will
test
market
a
caffeine-free
version
of
its
flagship
brand
,
Coca-Cola
Classic
,
beginning
next
week
in
Charlotte
,
N.C
.

Other
,
as
yet
unnamed
,
cities
will
follow
.

If
all
goes
well
,
the
product
will
be
rolled
out
for
national
sales
sometime
next
year
,
a
Coke
spokesman
said
.

After
the
confusion
surrounding
the
change
of
the
Coke
formula
in
1985
,
Coca-Cola
was
reluctant
to
clutter
the
Classic
name
with
a
brand
extension
.

But
now
,
the
soft-drink
giant
appears
willing
to
take
the
risk
.

``
The
name
Classic
Coke
has
tremendous
value
,
and
they
have
n't
merchandised
that
name
before
,
''
says
Jesse
Meyers
,
publisher
of
the
trade
journal
Beverage
Digest
.

The
Coke
spokesman
said
a
caffeine-free
Classic
should
help
increase
volume
of
the
original
brand
.

Indeed
,
analysts
have
said
that
the
absence
of
new
products
,
among
other
factors
,
has
limited
sales
growth
throughout
the
industry
.

Coke
now
leads
Pepsi
in
market
share
in
caffeine-free
diet
colas
but
trails
Pepsi
in
sales
of
caffeine-free
sugared
colas
,
according
to
Beverage
Digest
.

Coke
introduced
a
caffeine-free
sugared
cola
based
on
its
original
formula
in
1983
.

It
switched
to
a
caffeine-free
formula
using
its
new
Coke
in
1985
.

Coke
has
been
studying
the
possibility
of
introducing
a
caffeine-free
Classic
for
a
year
,
a
company
spokesman
said
.

He
said
large
increases
in
sales
of
other
non-caffeine
soft
drinks
make
the
timing
right
now
.

CALIFORNIA
STRUGGLED
with
the
aftermath
of
a
Bay
area
earthquake
.

As
aftershocks
shook
the
San
Francisco
Bay
area
,
rescuers
searched
through
rubble
for
survivors
of
Tuesday
's
temblor
,
and
residents
picked
their
way
through
glass-strewn
streets
.

In
Oakland
,
hopes
faded
for
finding
any
more
survivors
within
the
concrete
and
steel
from
the
collapse
of
an
interstate
highway
.

At
least
270
people
were
reported
killed
and
1,400
injured
in
the
rush-hour
tremor
that
caused
billions
of
dollars
of
damage
along
100
miles
of
the
San
Andreas
fault
.

Bush
declared
the
region
a
major
disaster
area
and
the
military
was
mobilized
to
prevent
looting
.

The
baseball
commissioner
said
the
third
game
of
the
World
Series
between
the
Giants
and
the
Athletics
would
be
played
Tuesday
in
Candlestick
Park
.

HONECKER
WAS
OUSTED
as
leader
of
East
Germany
amid
growing
unrest
.

The
77-year-old
official
,
who
oversaw
the
building
of
the
Berlin
Wall
,
was
removed
during
a
meeting
of
the
163-member
Communist
Party
Central
Committee
in
East
Berlin
.

Honecker
,
who
was
reported
ill
following
gall-bladder
surgery
in
August
,
said
he
was
resigning
for
health
reasons
.

He
was
succeeded
by
internal-security
chief
Egon
Krenz
,
52
,
a
hard-liner
who
quickly
ruled
out
any
sharing
of
power
with
pro-democracy
groups
.

Honecker
's
departure
came
after
weeks
of
street
protests
and
an
exodus
to
the
West
of
East
Germans
who
had
become
disenchanted
with
his
rule
.

HUNGARY
ADOPTED
constitutional
changes
to
form
a
democratic
system
.

At
a
nationally
televised
legislative
session
in
Budapest
,
the
Parliament
overwhelmingly
approved
changes
formally
ending
one-party
domination
in
the
country
,
regulating
free
elections
by
next
summer
and
establishing
the
office
of
state
president
to
replace
a
21-member
council
.

The
country
was
renamed
the
Republic
of
Hungary
.

Like
other
Soviet
bloc
nations
,
it
had
been
known
as
a
``
people
's
republic
''
since

The
voting
for
new
laws
followed
dissolution
of
Hungary
's
Communist
Party
this
month
and
its
replacement
by
a
Western-style
Socialist
Party
.

The
space
shuttle
Atlantis
blasted
into

on
a
flight
to
the

Jupiter
.

The

South
Korea
's
President
Roh
addressed
a
joint
House-Senate
meeting
and
urged
patience
over
U.S.
demands
for
the
opening
of
Seoul
's
markets
to
more
American
goods
,
saying
trade
issues
would
be
``
resolved
to
mutual
satisfaction
.
''

He
also
said
tragic
results
could
follow
any
``
hint
of
weakening
''
of
the
U.S.
defense
commitment
to
Seoul
.

The
Census
Bureau
reported
that
13.1
%
of
the
U.S.
population
,
or
31.9
million
people
,
were
living
in
poverty
in
1988
.

Last
year
's
figure
was
down
from
13.4
%
in
1987
and
marked
the
fifth
consecutive
annual
decline
in
the
poverty
rate
.

Per
capita
income
rose
1.7
%
to
$
13,120
,
but
median
family
income
fell
0.2
%
.

The
Bush
administration
accused
Israeli
Prime
Minister
Shamir
of
hindering
peace
efforts
in
the
Mideast
with
``
unhelpful
''
and
disappointing
statements
.

Shamir
said
Tuesday
that
he
was
prepared
to
risk
a
policy
conflict
with
the
U.S.
over
an
Egyptian
plan
to
hold
direct
Israeli-Palestinian
talks
,
which
the
premier
's
Likud
bloc
opposes
.

Cuba
was
elected
to
the
U.N.
Security
Council
for
the
first
time
since
its
Castro-led
revolution
30
years
ago
.

The
election
was
by
secret
ballot
in
the
General
Assembly
.

The
U.S.
did
n't
openly
oppose
Cuba
's
seating
as
the
Latin
American
council
delegate

Britain
's
Prime
Minister
Thatcher
told

Commonwealth
summit
in
Kuala

,
Malaysia
,
that
sanctions
against
South
Africa
were
``
utterly
irresponsible

''
officials
said
.

But
other
nations
at
the
opening
of
the
49-nation
meeting
of
Britain
and
its
former
colonies
pressed
for
continued
or
stronger
embargoes
in
an
effort
to
end
apartheid
.

Arab
officials
in
Saudi
Arabia
said
three-week-old
talks
by
Lebanese

about
to
collapse

Dow
Chemical
Co.
said
third-quarter
net
income
slipped
6.8
%
from
a
record
year-ago
quarter
.

The
decline
broke
a
streak
of
10
quarters
in
which
Dow
posted
earnings
increases
.

Dow
's
third-quarter
net
fell
to
$
589
million
,
or
$
3.29
a
share
,
from
$
632
million
,
or
$
3.36
a
share
,
a
year
ago
.

Sales
in
the
latest
quarter
rose
2
%
to
$
4.25
billion
from
$
4.15
billion
a
year
earlier
.

Dow
closed
at
$
94.625
a
share
,
up
75
cents
,
in
New
York
Stock
Exchange
composite
trading
.

A
spokeswoman
said
Dow
is
comfortable
with
Wall
Street
expectations
that
full-year
earnings
will
total
about
$
14.60
a
share
,
compared
with
last
year
's
record
net
of
$
2.4
billion
,
or
$
12.76
a
share
.

But
that
signal
on
full-year
profit
casts
doubt
on
whether
Dow
will
improve
on
its
year-ago
fourth-quarter
net
of
$
3.44
a
share
,
or
$
635
million
.

Dow
would
earn
$
14.85
a
share
for
the
year
if
it
equaled
that
year-ago
fourth-quarter
performance
.

Dow
officials
were
signaling
that
the
company
would
earn
less
than
$
15
a
share
this
year
even
before
they
announced
in
July
a
plan
to
acquire
67
%
of
Marion
Laboratories
Inc
.

That
acquisition
could
further
dilute
earnings
per
share
this
year
,
the
company
spokeswoman
said
.

Dow
has
n't
said
exactly
what
impact
the
Marion
acquisition
will
have
on
1989
earnings
.

Dow
blamed
the
third-quarter
earnings
drop
on
several
factors
,
including
softer
prices
for
polyethylene
and
other
basic
chemicals
,
a
slower
U.S.
economy
and
a
stronger
dollar
,
which
made
Dow
's
exports
from
the
U.S.
more
expensive
to
overseas
customers
.

Another
problem
was
a
7
%
increase
in
operating
costs
at
a
time
when
revenue
was
rising
by
only
2
%
.

For
the
first
nine
months
of
the
year
,
Dow
earned
$
2.06
billion
,
or
$
11.41
a
share
,
up
17
%
from
$
1.76
billion
,
or
$
9.32
a
share
,
a
year
ago
.

Sales
for
the
latest
nine
months
rose
7.7
%
to
$
13.34
billion
from
$
12.38
billion
in
the
year-ago
period
.

Whether
or
not
``
great
cases
make
bad-law
''
--
as
Justice
Holmes
asserted
--
who
can
doubt
that
when
great
confirmation
hearings
turn
on
the
nominee
's
response
to
these
great
cases
they
make
bad
judicial
history
?

Ethan
Bronner
's
``
Battle
for
Justice
:
How
the
Bork
Nomination
Shook
America
''
(
Norton
,
399
pages
,
$
22.50
)
is
a
spirited
narrative
of
the
nastiest
of
these
hearings
,
done
with
journalistic
verve
,
but
with
a
flawed
legal
philosophy
.

While
the
book
amply
justifies
its
subtitle
,
the
title
itself
is
dubious
.

What
shook
America
was
not
a
battle
for
justice
but
for
naked
power
,
in
which
an
army
of
judicial
activists
rolled
over
a
judge
they
had
demonized
.

In
its
basic
structure
and
style
the
book
is
novelistic
,
with
piquant
character
portrayal
,
hard-wire
action
and
devious
intrigue
of
the
sort
more
likely
to
be
encountered
in
a
Washington
docudrama
than
in
a
constitutional
history
.

Mr.
Bronner
seems
to
believe
that
the
hearings
could
have
gone
either
way
.

I
doubt
that
.

Given
Democratic
frustration
with
the
Reagan
victories
and
Court
appointments
,
the
contingency
plans
in
place
,
and
Mr.
Bork
's
paper
trail
of
vulnerable
writings
,
it
was
pretty
clear
that
Judge
Bork
never
stood
much
chance
of
being
confirmed
.

As
Mr.
Bronner
himself
says
,
the
smell
of
``
raw
meat
''
was
in
the
air
.

Perhaps
because
they
won
,
Mr.
Bork
's
attackers
come
through
more
vividly
than
his
defenders
.

Ralph
Neas
was
the
organizing
genius
,
whipping
a
conglomerate
of
pressure
groups
into
an
irresistible
attacking
force
.

Harvard
's
Laurence
Tribe
was
the
constitutional
heavy
,
laying
out
legal
strategies
for
the
senators
and
witnesses
to
follow
.

But
it
was
Ted
Kennedy
who
scored
most
effectively
with
his
searing
portrayal
of
``
Robert
Bork
's
America
''
--
the
parade
of
imaginary
horribles
that
would
follow
logically
,
he
claimed
,
from
the
positions
Mr.
Bork
had
taken
over
the
space
of
two
decades
.

Sen.
Kennedy
,
never
mind
his
dubious
credentials
for
the
moral
high
ground
,
emoted
brilliantly
.

I
add
two
others
.

Republican
Sen.
Arlen
Specter
of
Pennsylvania
engaged
the
nominee
in
a
verbal
contest
aimed
at
showing
that
Mr.
Bork
was
willing
to
stretch
the
Constitution
in
one
area
(
free
speech
)
while
remaining
rigid
in
all
the
others
.

It
achieved
a
good
media
play
,
and
enabled
Sen.
Specter
and
others
to
vote
against
Mr.
Bork
out
of
``
conscience
.
''

Further
ammunition
came
from
left
legal
theorist
Ronald
Dworkin
,
who
in
the
New
York
Review
of
Books
painted
a
picture
of
a
constitutional
zombie
willfully
reading
his
personal
prejudices
into
the
Constitution
,
particularly
in
the
area
of
``
original
intent
.
''

The
charge
of
being
``
outside
the
mainstream
''
of
legal
thought
gravely
undercut
Mr.
Bork
's
scholarly
standing
,
leaving
him
bleeding
on
the
platform
.

The
nomination
still
might
have
been
salvaged
if
a
number
of
Democratic
moderates
in
the
South
and
Southwest
had
broken
party
lines
.

But
Democratic
Sen.
Bennett
Johnson
of
Louisiana
reminded
the
little
band
that
anti-Bork
blacks
and
women
could
furnish
the
margin
to
punish
them
in
their
next
Senate
elections
.

Demographics
converged
with
``
mainstream
''
and
demonizing
to
seal
Robert
Bork
's
fate
.

The
upshot
?

Mr.
Bork
's
opponents
chose
the
battlefield
,
held
it
and
kept
it
.

Yet
with
the
smooth
confirmation
of
Anthony
Kennedy
,
an
``
80
percenter
''
only
slightly
less
supportive
of
judicial
restraint
than
Mr.
Bork
,
the
Democrats
may
have
won
the
battle
but
lost
the
war
.

Another
upshot
,
however
,
was
the
chilling
message
the
Bork
hearings
sent
into
the
judicial
culture
from
which
the
Supreme
Court
draws
its
talent
.

The
word
went
forth
to
every
law
school
that
those
with
federal
court
ambitions
must
travel
a
safe
constitutional
journey
,
with
no
paper
trail
and
no
bite
to
their
tongue
or
pen
.

Unfortunately
,
the
author
simply
does
n't
supply
the
philosophical
frame
to
sustain
his
reportorial
talents
.

He
has
too
readily
swallowed
the
case
for
the
activist
law
school
culture
.

Probing
more
deeply
into
the
doctrine
of
``
judicial
restraint
,
''
he
would
have
found
a
long
history
going
back
to
the
great
decisions
of
Justice
Holmes
.

He
would
discover
it
also
in
Alexander
Bickel
,
a
subtle
constitutional
scholar
,
Mr.
Bork
's
closest
friend
at
Yale
,
whose
influence
on
the
judge
goes
well
beyond
Mr.
Bronner
's
reporting
.

Still
,
the
long
view
of
Robert
Bork
as
constitutional
thinker
must
be
a
spotty
one
.

His
strength
lies
in
his
majoritarian
doctrine
,
which
keeps
the
Court
clear
of
transient
group
pressures
and
leaves
most
decisions
in
a
democracy
to
elected
legislatures
and
executives
.

Unfortunately
,
Mr.
Bork
failed
to
distinguish
between
such
pressures
and
the
emergence
of
great
issues
critical
to
a
society
that
must
be
settled
judicially
if
it
is
to
cohere
.

The
question
of
segregated
schools
,
in
Brown
vs.
Board
of
Education
,
was
such
an
issue
.

In
our
time
abortion
has
become
another
,
best
left
to
a
line
of
Supreme
Court
decisions
rather
than
to
the
chaos
of
50
state
legislatures
.

A
reflective
and
growing
consensus
of
Americans
clearly
wishes
to
apply
the
right
to
privacy
in
contraceptive
matters
(
decided
in
the
Griswold
case
)
to
abortion
as
well
.

One
can
understand
Mr.
Bork
's
fear
that
the
new
right
to
privacy
will
become
intolerably
stretched
,
though
a
Supreme
Court
composed
of
men
and
women
with
realism
,
guts
and
a
sense
of
limits
should
be
able
to
manage
it
.

What
is
certain
is
that
if
Americans
allow
another
happening
like
the
degrading
Bork
confirmation
circus
,
it
will
be
at
their
peril
.

Mr.
Lerner
is
a
writer
and
historian
living
in
New
York
.

Sotheby
's
Inc.
,
the
world
's
biggest
auction
house
,
is
taking
a
huge
Wall
Street-style
risk
on
the
outcome
of
the
sale
of
art
from
the
estate
of
John
T.
Dorrance
Jr.
,
the
Campbell
Soup
Co.
heir
.

The
Financial
Services
division
has
guaranteed
the
Dorrance
family
that
it
will
receive
a
minimum
of
$
100
million
for
the
collection
,
regardless
of
what
the
bids
for
the
art
works
total
,
people
close
to
the
transaction
say
.

The
collection
,
which
includes
two
early
Picassos
,
a
van
Gogh
,
a
Monet
,
other
paintings
,
furniture
and
porcelains
,
went
on
sale
last
night
in
the
first
of
six
auctions
.

What
Sotheby
's
is
doing
closely
resembles
an
underwriting
by
an
investment
bank
.

A
corporation
that
wants
to
sell
stock
or
bonds
goes
to
a
Wall
Street
firm
,
which
purchases
the
securities
outright
,
accepting
the
financial
risk
of
finding
buyers
.

If
the
investment
bank
can
sell
the
securities
at
a
higher
price
than
it
paid
the
issuer
,
it
makes
a
profit
.

At
the
initial
sale
last
night
,
for
example
--
the
sale
featuring
the
Impressionists
masters
--
bids
totaled
$
116
million
.

That
was
slightly
above
Sotheby
's
presale
estimate
of
$
111
million
.

Normally
,
Sotheby
's
would
have
earned
20
%
of
the
total
in
commissions
.

Instead
,
people
familiar
with
the
transaction
said
,
the
auction
house
opted
to
forgo
that
percentage
in
order
to
obtain
the
collection
and
in
exchange
for
taking
a
bigger
chunk
of
proceeds
exceeding
$
100
million
.

Art
dealers
say
that
while
auction
houses
occasionally
guarantee
the
seller
of
a
highly
desirable
work
of
art
a
minimum
price
,
a
financial
commitment
of
this
size
is
unprecedented
.

Diana
D.
Brooks
,
president
of
Sotheby
's
North
America
division
,
vehemently
denies
it
offered
the
Dorrance
heirs
a
money-back
guarantee
,
calling
such
reports
``
inaccurate
.
''

Buried
in
the
glossy
hardbound
catalog
for
the
sale
,
however
,
appears
the
statement
,
``
Sotheby
's
has
an
interest
in
the
property
in
this
catalog
.
''

Explains
a
Sotheby
's
spokeswoman
,
the
statement
``
means
exactly
what
it
says
.

We
have
some
level
of
financial
interest
''
in
the
collection
.

``
We
do
n't
disclose
specifics
.
''

Frank
Mirabello
,
a
lawyer
for
the
Dorrance
estate
with
the
Philadelphia
law
firm
of
Morgan
,
Lewis
&
Bockius
,
declines
to
comment
on
the
financial
arrangements
.

Sotheby
's
made
the
$
100
million
guarantee
to
keep
the
Dorrance
collection
away
from
its
archrival
,
auction
house
Christie
's
International
PLC
;
Christie
's
has
handled
smaller
sales
for
the
Dorrance
family
over
the
years
.

When
Christie
's
officials
asked
why
the
firm
was
n't
picked
to
sell
the
Dorrance
collection
,
representatives
of
the
Dorrance
family
``
told
us
it
was
a
question
of
financial
considerations
,
''
said
Michael
Findlay
,
Christie
's
head
of
impressionist
and
modern
paintings
.

Collectors
who
have
made
their
money
on
Wall
Street
have
become
an
increasingly
important
part
of
the
art
business
and
their
money
has
helped
fuel
the
art
boom
,
but
recently
it
appears
Sotheby
's
has
been
returning
the
compliment
.

In
November
1987
,
Sotheby
's
essentially
offered
a
Wall
Street-style
``
bridge
loan
''
of
about
$
27
million
to
Australian
businessman
Alan
Bond
to
enable
him
to
purchase
Vincent
van
Gogh
's
``
Irises
''
for
$
53.9
million
.

It
was
the
highest
bid
in
history
for
a
work
of
art
.

But
two
weeks
ago
,
Sotheby
's
said
that
it
has
the
painting
under
lock
and
key
because
the
loan
had
not
been
fully
repaid
.

Sotheby
's
is
offering
such
deals
because
it
's
an
art
sellers
'
market
,
at
least
where
the
best
works
are
concerned
,
says
Ralph
Lerner
,
an
attorney
and
author
of
the
book
``
Art
Law
.
''

``
There
seems
to
be
a
lot
of
art
for
sale
,
but
there
's
more
competition
.

The
competition
gives
the
seller
the
ability
to
cut
a
better
deal
,
''
he
says
.

The
Dorrance
family
will
still
receive
a
substantial
portion
of
the
auction
proceeds
above
$
100
million
,
people
familiar
with
the
transaction
said
.

But
it
's
likely
that
Sotheby
's
will
take
a
higher
than
usual
commission
,
called
an
override
,
on
the
amount
exceeding
the
guarantee
.

Sotheby
's
has
been
aggressively
promoting
the
Dorrance
sale
.

At
a
news
conference
last
May
announcing
plans
for
the
auction
,
Sotheby
's
estimated
its
value
in
excess
of
$
100
million
.

More
recently
,
Sotheby
's
has
predicted
the
collection
will
fetch
$
140
million
.

That
's
the
highest
estimate
for
a
single
collection
in
auction
history
.

The
decision
to
put
the
entire
collection
on
the
block
stunned
many
,
since
Mr.
Dorrance
had
served
as
chairman
of
the
Philadelphia
Museum
of
Art
,
and
it
had
been
assumed
many
of
the
works
would
be
donated
to
the
institution
.

At
last
night
's
sale
,
13
of
44
works
that
sold
were
purchased
by
Aska
International
Gallery
,
the
art-acquisition
unit
of
Aichi
Financial
,
a
Japanese
conglomerate
that
owns
7.5
%
of
Christie
's
.

Meanwhile
,
Sotheby
's
guarantee
is
raising
eyebrows
in
the
art
world
.

``
The
consumer
has
to
throw
out
the
idea
that
the
auction
house
is
a
disinterested
middleman
,
''
says
New
York
art
dealer
David
Tunick
.

While
he
adds
that
he
has
no
problem
with
auction
houses
who
sell
works
in
which
they
have
a
financial
interest
,
``
It
ought
not
to
be
hidden
in
some
small
print
.
''

In
such
situations
,
he
says
,
the
house
``
is
going
to
put
the
best
light
on
things
.
''

For
example
,
an
auction
house
's
comments
on
the
condition
of
a
work
of
art
that
is
up
for
sale
should
be
looked
at
with
``
very
open
eyes
,
''
he
says
.

``
There
's
more
and
more
of
this
cash-up-front
going
on
at
every
level
,
''
says
Bruce
Miller
,
president
of
Art
Funding
Corp.
,
an
art
lender
.

Dealers
and
auction
houses
``
know
if
they
do
n't
lay
out
a
half
a
million
for
this
,
another
one
will
;
it
's
that
competitive
.
''

In
January
,
two
small
New
York
galleries
,
the
Coe
Kerr
Gallery
and
Beadleston
Fine
Arts
,
snatched
a
major
art
collection
owned
by
the
Askin
family
away
from
rival
auction-house
bidders
with
an
up-front
payment
of
about
$
25
million
.

A
Christie
's
spokeswoman
said
that
while
the
auction
house
sometimes
waives
its
seller
's
commission
to
attract
art
works
--
it
still
gets
a
commission
from
the
buyer
--
Christie
's
wo
n't
offer
financial
guarantees
because
``
Christie
's
believes
its
primary
role
is
as
an
auction
house
,
and
therefore
as
an
agent
{
for
buyer
and
seller
}
,
not
as
a
bank
.

Egon
Krenz
,
the
man
tapped
yesterday
to
become
East
Germany
's
new
leader
,
faces
the
same
task
that
has
fallen
to
neighboring
socialist
colleagues
:
reforming
a
country
in
crisis
.

But
unlike
the
other
new
leaders
in
the
East
Bloc
,
Mr.
Krenz
will
face
an
immediate
threat
to
his
nation
's
very
existence
:
German
reunification
.

Mr.
Krenz
,
age
52
,
is
known
as
an
old-guard
ironfist
,
one
likely
to
continue
the
method
of
running
a
country
that
the
Berlin
Wall
made
famous
.

Even
if
he
were
to
change
his
stripes
and
become
another
Milton
Friedman
,
however
,
he
would
still
stand
a
good
chance
of
losing
a
country
.

Mr.
Krenz
almost
certainly
will
be
a
younger
version
of
Erich
Honecker
,
his
rigid
predecessor
as
dictator
.

Mr.
Krenz
has
followed
much
the
same
career
path
as
Mr.
Honecker
:
Both
spent
years
overseeing
the
Freie
Deutsche
Jugend
,
the
youth
group
that
is
the
communist
regime
's
principal
tool
for
stamping
young
Germans
into
socialist
citizens
.

More
recently
,
Mr.
Krenz
has
been
in
charge
of
East
German
security
,
and
is
the
youngest
member
of
the
ruling
Politburo
.

Faced
with
another
Mr.
Honecker
,
so
many
despairing
East
Germans
are
likely
to
flee
that
the
two
German
peoples
will
get
their
reunification
,
de
facto
,
on
West
German
ground
.

But
if
East
Germany
's
arthritic
Politburo
does
loosen
up
enough
to
permit
Mr.
Krenz
to
make
serious
efforts
at
reform
,
he
will
face
a
challenge
just
as
fundamental
.

Abandoning
socialism
means
abandoning
the
East
German
state
's
reason
for
existence
,
and
with
it
the
justification
for
its
watchdogs
and
its
Wall
.

In
this
scenario
it
's
hard
to
imagine
that
a
pale
imitation
of
the
Federal
Republic
could
avoid
being
pulled
into
some
kind
of
tie
--
economic
,
federal
or
stronger
--
with
West
Germany
.

Mr.
Krenz
may
need
a
bit
of
time
to
consolidate
his
empire
,
which
would
do
a
lot
to
promote
Reunification
Scenario
One
.

Cartoonists
in
West
Germany
have
already
mocked
the
exodus
by
imagining
an
advertisement
placed
by
Mr.
Honecker
:
``
Wanted
:
one
people
.
''

The
West
German
embassies
in
Prague
,
Budapest
and
Warsaw
are
continuing
to
find
refugees
at
their
gates
.

Of
course
East
Germany
,
true
to
its
tradition
,
could
tighten
its
borders
yet
further
.

Two
of
the
last
gestures
of
the
Honecker
regime
were
to
close
the
border
to
Czechoslovakia
and
install
halogen
lights
in
some
spots
along
the
frontier
.

But
with
world-wide
opinion
--
even
,
apparently
in
Moscow
--
against
East
Germany
,
the
country
would
have
to
turn
itself
into
an
Albania
to
clamp
down
further
on
refugees
.

There
have
been
some
reports
that
Mr.
Krenz
is
moving
to
``
soften
''
his
reputation
,
notably
rumors
that
it
was
he
who
kept
East
Germany
's
state
police
off
protesters
'
backs
at
the
country
's
dismal
40th
anniversary
celebrations
earlier
this
month
.

But
even
if
he
effects
a
Hyde-to-Jekyll
transformation
,
he
will
face
a
serious
ideological
crisis
and
Reunification
Scenario
Two
.

The
problem
is
one
that
East
Germany
shares
with
other
half-states
,
such
as
North
Korea
,
but
one
it
must
shoulder
alone
in
the
East
Bloc
.

When
Poland
moves
to
reform
,
it
can
at
least
lean
on
its
past
:
However
flawed
and
short-lived
Joseph
Pilsudski
's
interwar
republic
,
it
was
a
nonsocialist
democracy
.

Czech
reformers
can
recall
the
Wilsonian
ideals
of
the
same
period
in
their
country
.

Even
the
Soviet
Union
has
Peter
the
Great
to
rediscover
,
should
it
choose
to
.

But
East
Germany
is
merely
``
the
land
of
truly
existing
socialism
.
''

Beyond
that
,
it
has
to
compete
with
West
Germany
for
a
claim
to
the
German
identity
.

Up
to
now
,
the
main
weapon
of
the
``
worker
and
peasant
state
''
has
been
the
ideology
of
socialism
.

With
talk
today
of
a
second
economic
miracle
in
West
Germany
,
East
Germany
no
longer
can
content
itself
with
being
the
economic
star
in
a
loser
league
.

Without
Moscow
's
military
and
party
behind
it
,
East
Germany
runs
the
risk
of
disintegrating
.

If
it
goes
capitalist
,
and
increases
trade
with
West
Germany
,
it
will
convert
itself
,
willy-nilly
,
into
an
economic
annex
of
the
Federal
Republic
.

There
's
a
certain
cruel
logic
at
work
here
:
It
's
particularly
appropriate
--
and
tragic
--
that
the
land
that
produced
Karl
Marx
should
prove
socialism
's
failure
in
an
experiment
that
uses
its
own
people
as
controls
.

There
may
be
forces
that
would
delay
this
scenario
.

Ideologues
are
the
last
to
surrender
,
and
Germans
are
an
ideological
people
.

The
protesters
who
greeted
Mikhail
Gorbachev
at
East
Berlin
's
airport
earlier
this
month
were
n't
shouting
``
Go
U.S.A
''
--
they
were
chanting
``
Gorby
,
Help
Us
.
''

Ideologues
on
the
other
side
of
the
border
can
also
slow
the
process
.

Helmut
Kohl
's
governing
conservative
coalition
is
proving
admirably
true
to
the
West
German
constitution
by
making
more
than
500,000
people
of
German
descent
automatic
citizens
this
year
alone
.

But
within
the
government
and
in
the
think
tanks
outside
it
,
many
West
Germans
maintain
that
they
do
n't
want
immediate
reunification
.

Politically
,
this
currently
is
wisdom
--
particularly
given
a
nervous
neighboring
France
.

But
it
would
be
ironic
if
Germany
's
reunification
,
just
like
its
division
,
eventually
were
the
result
of
actions
in
centers
of
power
other
than
Bonn
and
Berlin
.

In
a
statement
that
was
as
close
as
East
Germany
gets
to
practicing
``
glasnost
''
,
Otto
Reinhold
,
an
East
German
party
theorist
,
actually
acknowledged
the
reunification
dilemma
.

``
The
main
problem
,
''
Mr.
Reinhold
said
in
an
East
German
radio
interview
monitored
by
Radio
Free
Europe
in
Munich
,
stems
from
the
fact
that
``
the
GDR
is
different
''
from
other
East
European
states
.

``
What
kind
of
right
to
exist
,
''
he
asked
,
``
would
a
capitalist
German
Democratic
Republic
have
alongside
a
capitalist
Federal
Republic
?
''

That
's
a
question
East
Germany
ca
n't
answer
easily
,
no
matter
what
its
new
leader
does
.

News
of
the
major
earthquake
in
California
Tuesday
triggered
a
round
of
dollar
sales
in
early
Asian
trade
,
but
most
foreign-exchange
dealers
said
they
expect
the
impact
of
the
quake
on
financial
markets
to
be
short-lived
.

Despite
the
dollar
's
lackluster
performance
,
some
foreign-exchange
traders
maintain
that
the
U.S.
unit
remains
relatively
well
bid
.

Harris
Trust
's
Mr.
Woodland
noted
that
the
unit
continues
to
show
resilience
in
the
face
of
a
barrage
of
``
headline
negatives
''
in
recent
weeks
,
including
rate
increases
in
Europe
and
Japan
,
aggressive
central
bank
intervention
,
a
190-point
plunge
in
New
York
stock
prices
,
an
unexpectedly
poor
U.S.
trade
report
and
action
by
the
Federal
Reserve
to
nudge
U.S.
rates
lower
.

While
Mr.
Woodland
does
n't
predict
a
significant
climb
for
the
U.S.
unit
in
light
of
recent
moves
in
interest
rates
around
the
world
,
he
noted
that
``
its
downside
potential
is
surprisingly
and
--
for
dollar
bulls
--
``
impressively
''
limited
.

In
late
New

trading
yesterday
,
the
dollar
was
quoted
at
1.8485
marks
,
down
from
1.8667
marks
late
Tuesday
,
and
at

down

Since
Friday
's
dive
in
stock
market
prices
,
the
Fed
has
injected
reserves
into
the
banking
system
in
an
effort
to
calm
the
markets
and
avert
a
repeat
of
1987
's
stock
market
debacle
.

Some
analysts
note
that
after
last
week
's
stock
market
tailspin
and
Tuesday
's
California
earthquake
,
it
's
hard
to
gauge
where
the
central
bank
wants
the
key
federal
funds
rate
.

They
say
that
the
earthquake
,
by
preventing
many
banks
from
operating
at
full
capacity
,
has
given
the
Fed
an
additional
reason
to
keep
liquidity
at
a
high
level
.

The
Fed
did
,
in
fact
,
execute
$
1.5
billion
of
liquidity-enhancing
customer
repurchase
agreements
,
the
third
set
of
repurchase
orders
in
three
days
.

Analysts
said
the
additional
liquidity
should
tend
to
reduce
the
federal
funds
rate
.

For
now
,
traders
say
the
foreign
exchange
market
is
scrutinizing
both
federal
funds
and
events
on
Wall
Street
.

They
note
that
the
dollar
remains
extremely
vulnerable
to
the
slightest
bad
news
from
the
stock
exchange
.

Indeed
,
the
U.S.
unit
edged
lower
as
the
Dow
Jones
Industrial
Average
dropped
about
13
points
in
early
trading
.

A
slight
recovery
in
the
stock
market
gave
currency
traders
confidence
to
push
the
dollar
higher
before
the
unit
dropped
back
by
day
's
end
.

Some
dealers
noted
that
nervousness
over
the
recent
sharp
dive
in
stock
prices
could
intensify
following
suggestions
by
Bank
of
Japan
Governor
Satoshi
Sumita
that
appeared
to
advise
Japanese
investors
to
be
very
careful
in
investing
in
U.S.
leveraged
buy-outs
.

Dealers
suggest
that
the
only
positive
news
on
the
horizon
that
could
detract
attention
from
equities
transactions
is
September
's
U.S.
consumer
price
data
.

The
figures
,
due
for
release
Friday
,
are
expected
to
show
an
uptick
in
inflation
to
4.8
%
from
4.7
%
in
August
.

If
the
figures
show
a
hefty
rise
in
inflation
,
they
could
militate
against
easing
by
the
Fed
.

On

Crude
prices
spurted
upward
in
brisk
trading
on
the
assumption
that
heavy
earthquake
damage
occurred
to
San
Francisco
area
refinery
complexes
,
but
the
rise
quickly
fizzled
when
it
became
apparent
that
oil
operations
were
n't
severely
curtailed
.

Trading
on
little
specific
information
,
market
players
overnight
in
Tokyo
began
bidding
up
oil
prices
.

The
rally
spread
into
European
markets
,
where
traders
were
still
betting
that
the
earthquake
disrupted
the
San
Francisco
area
's
large
oil
refining
plants
.

By
yesterday
morning
,
much
of
the
world
was
still
unable
to
reach
San
Francisco
by
telephone
.

West
Texas
Intermediate
was
bid
up
more
than
20
cents
a
barrel
in
many
overseas
markets
.

At
the
opening
of
the
New
York
Mercantile
Exchange
,
West
Texas
Intermediate
for
November
delivery
shot
up
10
cents
a
barrel
,
to
$
20.85
,
still
on
the
belief
that
the
refineries
were
damaged
.

In
the
San
Francisco
area
,
roughly
800,000
barrels
a
day
of
crude
,
about
a
third
of
all
the
refining
capacity
in
California
,
is
processed
daily
,
according
to
industry
data
.

For
more
than
the
past
year
,
even
the
rumor
of
a
major
West
Coast
refinery
shutdown
has
been
enough
to
spark
a
futures
rally
because
the
gasoline
market
is
so
tight
.

But
yesterday
,
as
the
morning
wore
on
,
some
major
West
Coast
refinery
operators
--
including
Chevron
Corp.
,
Exxon
Corp.
and
the
Shell
Oil
Co.
unit
of
Royal
Dutch\/Shell
Group
--
said
their
refineries
were
n't
damaged
and
were
continuing
to
operate
normally
.

Most
said
they
shut
down
their
petroleum
pipeline
operations
as
a
precaution
but
did
n't
see
any
immediate
damage
.

Gasoline
terminals
were
also
largely
unhurt
,
they
said
.

``
It
's
hard
to
imagine
how
the
markets
were
speculating
,
given
that
nobody
could
get
through
to
San
Francisco
,
''
said
one
amazed
oil
company
executive
.

As
the
news
spread
that
the
refineries
were
intact
,
crude
prices
plunged
,
ending
the
day
at
$
20.56
a
barrel
,
down
19
cents
.

Gasoline
for
November
delivery
was
off
1.26
cents
a
gallon
to
54.58
cents
.

Heating
oil
finished
at
60.6
cents
,
down
0.45
cent
.

``
The
market
was
basically
acting
on
two
contradictory
forces
,
''
said
Nauman
Barakat
of
Shearson
Lehman
Hutton
Inc
.

``
One
is
the
panic
,
the
earthquake
in
San
Francisco
,
which
is
positive
.
''

But
once
that
factor
was
eliminated
,
traders
took
profits
and
focused
on
crude
oil
inventories
,
Mr.
Barakat
said
.

After
the
market
closed
Tuesday
,
the
American
Petroleum
Institute
had
reported
that
crude
stocks
increased
by
5.7
million
barrels
in
the
week
ended
Friday
,
which
traders
viewed
as
bearish
.

But
some
market
players
still
think
earthquake
speculation
could
have
more
impact
on
the
oil
markets
.

``
The
problem
is
that
while
on
the
surface
everything
is
all
right
,
the
question
is
,
''
said
Mr.
Barakat
,
``
was
there
any
structural
damage
to
the
pipelines
or
anything
else
.

In

commodity
markets
yesterday
:

COPPER
:

Futures
prices
eased
on
indications
of
improvement
in
the
industry
's
labor
situation
.

The
December
contract
declined
1.85
cents
a
pound
to
$
1.2645
.

According
to
one
analyst
,
workers
at
the
Cananea
copper
mine
in
Mexico
,
which
has
n't
been
operating
since
it
was
declared
bankrupt
by
the
Mexican
government
in
late
August
,
are
set
to
return
to
work
.

The
analyst
said
it
will
take
about
two
to
three
months
before
the
mine
begins
to
produce
copper
in
significant
quantities
.

He
added
that
,
while
there
has
n't
been
any
official
announcement
as
yet
,
the
Highland
Valley
mine
strike
in
British
Columbia
,
which
has
lasted
more
than
three
months
,
is
regarded
as
settled
.

Another
analyst
said
the
Cananea
return
to
operation
may
not
be
as
near
as
some
expect
.

``
There
are
still
negotiations
taking
place
on
whether
there
will
be
a
loss
of
jobs
,
which
has
been
a
critical
issue
all
along
,
''
he
said
.

Nevertheless
,
the
increasing
likelihood
that
these
two
major
supply
disruptions
will
be
resolved
weighed
on
the
market
,
the
analysts
agreed
.

Both
of
these
mines
are
normally
major
suppliers
of
copper
to
Japan
,
which
has
been
buying
copper
on
the
world
market
.

The
first
analyst
said
that
the
Japanese
,
as
well
as
the
Chinese
,
bought
copper
earlier
in
the
week
in
London
,
but
that
this
purchasing
has
since
slackened
as
the
supply
situation
,
at
least
over
the
long
term
,
appears
to
have
improved
.

``
The
focus
for
some
time
has
been
on
the
copper
supply
,
and
good
demand
has
been
taken
for
granted
,
''
he
said
.

``
Now
that
the
supply
situation
seems
to
be
improving
,
it
would
be
best
for
traders
to
switch
their
concentration
to
the
demand
side
.
''

He
noted
the
Commerce
Department
report
yesterday
that
housing
starts
in
September
dropped
5.2
%
from
August
to
1.26
million
units
on
an
annualized
basis
,
the
lowest
level
in
seven
years
.

``
Along
with
these
factors
,
other
economic
reports
suggest
a
slowing
of
the
economy
,
which
could
mean
reduced
copper
usage
,

said

SUGAR
:

Futures
prices
extended
Tuesday
's
gains
.

The
March
delivery
ended
with
an
advance
of
0.16
cent
a
pound
to
14.27
cents
,
for
a
two-day
gain
of
0.3
cent
.

According
to
one
dealer
,
Japan
said
it
has
only
40,000
tons
of
sugar
remaining
to
be
shipped
to
it
this
year
by
Cuba
under
current
commitments
.

The
announcement
was
made
because
of
reports
Tuesday
that
Cuba
would
delay
shipments
to
Japan
scheduled
for
later
this
year
,
into
early
next
year
.

The
dealer
said
the
quantity
mentioned
in
the
Japanese
announcement
is
so
small
that
it
's
meaningless
.

One
analyst
said
he
thought
the
market
continued
to
be
supported
to
some
degree
by
a
delay
in
the
Cuban
sugar
harvest
caused
by
adverse
weather
.

The
dealer
said
India
might
be
the
real
factor
that
is
keeping
futures
prices
firm
.

That
country
recently
bought
200,000
tons
of
sugar
and
had
been
expected
to
seek
a
like
quantity
last
week
but
did
n't
.

``
It
's
known
they
need
the
sugar
,
and
the
expectation
that
they
will
come
in
is
apparently
giving
the
market
its
principal
support
,
''
the
dealer
said
.

LIVESTOCK
AND
MEATS
:

The
Agriculture
Department
is
expected
to
announce
tomorrow
that
the
number
of
cattle
in
the
13
major
ranch
states
slipped
4
%
to
8.21
million
on
Oct.
1
compared
with
the
level
a
year
earlier
,
said
Tom
Morgan
,
president
of
Sterling
Research
Corp.
,
Arlington
Heights
,
Ill
.

Cattle
prices
have
risen
in
recent
weeks
on
speculation
that
the
government
's
quarterly
report
will
signal
tighter
supplies
of
beef
.

Among
other
things
,
the
government
is
expected
to
report
that
the
number
of
young
cattle
placed
on
feedlots
during
the
quarter
slipped
3
%
.

Feedlots
fatten
cattle
for
slaughter
,
so
a
drop
indicates
that
the
production
of
beef
will
dip
this
winter
.

Indeed
,
some
analysts
expect
the
government
to
report
that
the
movement
of
young
cattle
onto
feedlots
in
the
month
of
September
in
seven
big
ranch
states
dropped
8
%
compared
with
the
level
for
September
1988
.

A
new
drug
to
prevent
the
rejection
of
transplanted
organs
has
been
successfully
used
on
more
than
100
patients
at
the
University
of
Pittsburgh
,
according
to
researchers
.

The
drug
,
which
is
still
in
the
experimental
phase
,
has
n't
been
approved
yet
by
the
Food
and
Drug
Admistration
,
and
its
long-term
effects
are
unknown
.

But
researchers
say
the
drug
,
called
FK-506
,
could
revolutionize
the
transplantation
field
by
reducing
harmful
side
effects
and
by
lowering
rejection
rates
.

Rejection
has
been
the
major
obstacle
in
the
approximately
30,000
organ
transplants
performed
world-wide
each
year
.

Researchers
began
using
the
drug
in
February
on
patients
who
had
received
kidney
,
liver
,
heart
and
pancreas
transplants
.

Only
two
of
111
transplants
have
been
rejected
.

The
drug
,
discovered
in
1984
,
is
metabolized
from
soil
fungus
found
in
Japan
.

The
Pittsburgh
patients
are
the
first
humans
to
be
given
the
drug
,
which
is
made
by
Fujisawa
Pharmaceutical
Co
.

``
We
're
shocked
by
it
,
because
it
's
worked
so
fast
,
''
said
Dr.
Thomas
E.
Starzl
,
director
of
the
University
of
Pittsburgh
Transplantation
Program
,
at
a
news
conference
here
yesterday
.

``
We
consider
it
a
life-saving
drug
,
like
one
for
AIDS
,
''
said
Dr.
John
Fung
,
an
immunologist
at
the
University
of
Pittsburgh
.

Researchers
say
they
believe
FK-506
is
100
times
more
effective
than
the
traditional
anti-rejection
drug
,
cyclosporine
,
made
by
Swiss
pharmaceutical
giant
Sandoz
Ltd
.

They
are
also
encouraged
by
the
relatively
mild
side
effects
of
FK-506
,
compared
with
cyclosporine
,
which
can
cause
renal
failure
,
morbidity
,
nausea
and
other
problems
.

``
The
side
effects
{
of
cyclosporine
}
have
made
the
penalty
for
its
success
rather
high
,
''
Dr.
Starzl
said
.

Dr.
Fung
said
that
FK-506
would
not
be
available
in
the
market
for
at
least
a
year
,
and
that
the
FDA
approval
process
usually
takes
three
years
to
five
years
.

There
are
no
firm
plans
to
expand
the
experimental
program
beyond
the
University
of
Pittsburgh
,
whose
hospital
performs
the
most
transplants
in
the
world
.

Researchers
could
n't
estimate
the
cost
of
the
drug
when
it
reaches
the
market
,
but
they
said
FK-506
will
enable
patients
to
cut
hospital
stays
by
50
%
and
reduce
the
number
of
blood
tests
used
to
monitor
the
dosage
of
cyclosporine
and
other
drugs
among
transplant
recipients
.

Dr.
Starzl
said
the
research
has
been
largely
financed
by
the
National
Institute
of
Health
and
by
university
funds
,
and
that
Fujisawa
did
n't
give
the
hospital
any
grants
.

He
said
that
the
research
team
had
no
financial
stake
in
the
drug
.

``
We
've
known
for
six
months
the
effect
of
this
drug
,
and
our
advice
to
our
people
has
been
not
to
buy
the
company
's
stock
,
''
Dr.
Starzl
said
,
adding
that
profiting
from
FK-506
would
n't
be
ethical
.

Economist
David
N.
Laband
's
Sept.
27
editorial-page
article
,
``
In
Hugo
's
Path
,
a
Man-Made
Disaster
,
''
decries
the
control
of
price
gouging
,
swiftly
ordered
by
South
Carolina
's
governor
after
Hurricane
Hugo
.

According
to
Mr.
Laband
,
``
screaming
''
for
price
controls
occurs
when
income
redistribution
``
threatens
to
hit
home
.
''

To
be
sure
,
the
threat
has
hit
home
down
here
.

Yet
in
Mr.
Laband
's
rehash
of
free-market
logic
,
human
greed
and
self-interest
are
the
only
permissible
psychological
reactions
.

Allowing
uncontrolled
prices
for
necessities
would
indeed
shorten
the
lines
at
stores
,
as
he
contends
.

But
not
because
resources
are
going
to
their
most
efficient
use
,
leaving
scarce
goods
``
allocated
to
those
buyers
who
place
the
highest
value
on
them
.
''

Rather
,
lines
would
diminish
because
at
higher
prices
many
victims
could
not
afford
necessities
such
as
food
and
medical
supplies
.

It
is
inhumane
to
imply
that
a
poor
,
unemployed
woman
can
not
receive
immediate
relief
for
her
family
at
fair
prices
because
she
does
not
have
as
much
to
protect
as
a
rich
family
.

Moreover
,
essential
relief
supplies
such
as
ice
must
be
distributed
throughout
the
population
because
of
potential
health
problems
from
spoiled
food
and
possible
outbreak
of
disease
.

Such
spillover
effects
give
the
state
a
right
to
intervene
in
the
marketplace
and
temporarily
coordinate
allocation
of
resources
.

Fortunately
,
volunteers
and
charities
are
not
motivated
by
self-interest
,
but
by
altruism
.

Why
should
they
have
to
co-exist
with
opportunists
rushing
in
to
turn
a
quick
profit
?

These
latter-day
scalawags
would
be
ill-advised
to
take
advantage
of
the
situation
,
if
they
ever
expect
to
face
the
people
of
South
Carolina
again
.

The
government
is
actually
protecting
avaricious
ice-baggers
and
other
profiteers
who
can
not
see
beyond
their
own
short-term
gain
.

South
Carolina
deserves
an
A
for
its
quick
and
timely
relief
efforts
.

Mr.
Laband
,
meanwhile
,
gets
an
A
for
his
rote
recital
of
economic-efficiency
arguments
.

Give
him
an
F
for
his
failure
to
understand
the
ethics
of
economic
equity

Mr.
Laband
gives
us
an
idea
why
economists
'
predictions
are
usually
wrong
.

They
set
up
absurd
situations
,
detached
from
reality
,
and
then
try
to
reason
from
them
.

I
'm
surprised
he
did
n't
advocate
letting
people
loot
,
since
that
behavior
can
also
be
foreseen
in
a
disaster
and
``
every
individual
has
an
incentive
to
alter
the
distribution
of
income
in
his
favor
.
''

Price
controls
were
``
so
fervently
embraced
by
Charleston
''
because
price
gouging
in
this
situation
is
equivalent
to
looting
.

Foster

Mr.
Laband
described
one
of
the
more
insidious
threats
we
face
when
dealing
with
disasters
such
as
Hugo
--
anti-profiteering
ordinances
such
as
that
by
the
Charleston
City
Council
as
it
thrashed
about
trying
to
Do
Something
.

Since
he
concentrated
on
the
economic
folly
of
such
ordinances
,
he
did
n't
mention
certain
other
of
their
effects
.

They
divert
law-enforcement
resources
at
a
time
they
are
most
needed
for
protecting
lives
and
property
.

Also
,
rather
than
increase
supplies
,
they
reduce
them
and
encourage
hoarding
.

And
they
,
or
even
the
prospect
of
them
,
discourage
disaster
preparedness
in
the
form
of
speculative
advance
stocking
of
supplies
by
merchants
.

Would
Mr.
Laband
also
suggest
that
the
Red
Cross
,
Salvation
Army
,
military
units
,
police
,
fire
departments
,
rescue
units
and
individual
citizens
cease
their
efforts
to
assist
Hugo
's
victims
because
they
interfere
with
his
concept
of
the
``
free
market
''
?

What
about
those
caring
people
all
over
the
country
who
are
donating
food
,
water
and
other
necessities
of
life
to
these
people
who
could
be
any
of
us
?

Should
they
,
too
,
stop
``
messing
with
''
his
free
market
?

Maybe
he
thinks
they
should
also
sell
to
the
highest
bidder
.

And
what
about
insurance
firms
?

Should
they
be
required
to
pay
claims
based
on
exorbitant
costs
for
labor
and
materials
?

Mr.
Laband
should
beware
,
since
he
lives
in
South
Carolina
.

In
a
free
market
,
his
insurance
rates
can
be
raised
to
recover
insurance-company
losses
.

Having
been
through
several
tornadoes
and
hurricanes
,
I
have
a
different
perspective
.

Mine
comes
from
seeing
thriving
communities
devastated
--
but
only
temporarily
.

Their
recovery
came
surprisingly
fast
,
and
always
with
the
help
of
neighbors
.

The
shock
of
seeing
homes
destroyed
and
city
services
disrupted
may
cause
some
to
confuse
priorities
such
as
the
true
economic
value
of
a
freezer
full
of
meat
.

In
Texas
after
Hurricane
Alicia
,
major
grocery
chains
used
their
truck
fleets
to
ship
essential
goods
to
Houston
,
no
gouging
,
just
good
will
.

We
here
in
the
affected
areas
were
dazzled
by
Mr.
Laband
's
analysis
of
time
values
and
his
comparisons
of
effectiveness
concerning
research
and
development
.

His
theoretical
approach
and
its
publication
in
this
venerable
paper
are
no
doubt
a
noteworthy
accomplishment
for
him
.

Too
bad
theory
fails
in
practice
.

We
consumers
tend
to
have
long
memories
.

The
businesses
subscribing
to
Mr.
Laband
's
effective
price
system
will
be
remembered
when
normalcy
returns
.

Perhaps
,
considering
the
value
of
our
time
,
we
will
be
unable
to
patronize
their
establishments
in
the
post-Hugo
era
.

I
have
a
question
for
Mr.
Laband
:
How
do
I
explain
to
the
single
mother
of
three
standing
in
line
next
to
me
for
the
past
three
hours
that
the
two
bags
of
ice
she
needs
to
keep
her
children
's
food
edible
will
take
her
last
$
20
?

I
'm
sure
she
'll
appreciate
what
an
efficient
reaction
to
her
problems
the
price
system
has
created
.

This
seems
to
be
the
season
for
revivals
in
Chicago
.

Though
the
Cubs
'
championship
season
ended
with
the
National
League
playoffs
,
a
revival
of
the
Organic
Theater
's
production
of
``
Bleacher
Bums
,
''
a
play
in
nine
innings
set
in
the
Wrigley
Field
bleachers
,
continues
within
spitting
distance
of
the
ballpark
.

Revivals
of
a
different
sort
also
are
being
offered
by
our
two
major
theater
troupes
,
the
Goodman
and
Steppenwolf
.

Each
is
more
problematic
than
an
unexpected
divisional
baseball
championship
,
but
both
help
explain
why
Chicago
remains
a
vital
center
of
this
country
's
regional
theater
movement
.

The
Goodman
is
offering
a
modernized
version
of
Moliere
's
``
The
Misanthrope
''
through
Nov.
4
.

The
original
is
a
comedy
about
Alceste
,
a
man
who
sees
falseness
and
vanity
in
everyone
except
himself
.

He
is
the
jealous
friend
of
Philinte
,
and
the
jealous
lover
of
Celimene
.

The
play
is
filled
with
intrigue
,
dishonesty
and
injustice
.

Twenty-five
years
ago
the
poet
Richard
Wilbur
modernized
this
17th-century
comedy
merely
by
avoiding
``
the
zounds
sort
of
thing
,
''
as
he
wrote
in
his
introduction
.

Otherwise
,
the
scene
remained
Celimene
's
house
in
1666
.

Assuming
modern
audiences
readily
understand
that
Moliere
's
social
indictment
covers
their
world
as
well
as
17th-century
Paris
,
Mr.
Wilbur
concentrated
his
formidable
artistry
on
rendering
the
Alexandrine
French
verse
into
sprightly
and
theatrical
English
iambic
pentameter
.

The
Wilbur
translation
is
remarkable
--
well
worth
a
read
and
even
better
seen
in
the
theater
if
you
ever
have
the
opportunity
.

But
if
you
happen
to
be
coming
to
Chicago
in
the
next
few
weeks
,
do
n't
fail
to
have
a
look
at
Robert
Falls
's
``
The
Misanthrope
''
at
the
Goodman
.

If
Mr.
Wilbur
's
translation
is
a
finely
ground
lens
through
which
we
see
the
pettiness
and
corruption
of
17th-century
Paris
,
Mr.
Falls
's
production
is
a
mirror
in
which
we
see
ourselves
.

Mr.
Falls
,
the
Goodman
's
artistic
director
,
took
a
recent
adaptation
by
Neil
Bartlett
and
significantly
adapted
it
.

Mr.
Bartlett
had
slimmed
Moliere
's
cast
of
characters
to
six
and
set
them
in
the
London
media
world
of
Thatcherite
Britain
.

Mr.
Falls
transfers
the
setting
to
Hollywood
,
and
transforms
the
characters
into
what
passes
for
aristocracy
there
--
agents
,
producers
,
actors
,
writers
and
sycophants
.

It
works
.

Mr.
Bartlett
managed
to
more
or
less
maintain
Moliere
's
Alexandrine
verse
form
,
12
syllable
lines
in
rhyming
couplets
.

Mr.
Falls
kept
the
form
,
but
Americanized
it
with
Mr.
Bartlett
's
further
help
.

With
a
splendid
cast
led
by
David
Darlow
as
Alceste
,
Christina
Haag
as

and
,
especially
,
William
Brown
as
a
Philinte
who
plays
the
Hollywood
game
but
harbors
authentic
values
and
feelings
,
the
Goodman
production
barrels
through
an
all-night
Hollywood
party
with
exuberance
and
wit
.

If
this
version
,
with
its
references
to
Steven
Spielberg
,
Spago
and
``
thirtysomething
''
attracts
younger
audiences
who
might
stay
away
from
the
classical
version
,
then
Messrs.
Bartlett
and
Falls
are
justified
in
abandoning
Mr.
Wilbur
.

A
300-year-old
play
may
be
easier
to
revive
than
one
merely
25
.

The
Steppenwolf
Theatre
Company
,
back
from
a
critical
and
box
office
success
in
London
with
its
adaptation
of
Steinbeck
's
``
The
Grapes
of
Wrath
,
''
opened
the
new
season
with
Harold
Pinter
's
``
The
Homecoming
,
''
first
produced
by
the
Royal
Shakespeare
Company
in
1965
.

Back
then
,
Mr.
Pinter
was
not
only
the
angry
young
British
playwright
,
but
also
the
first
to
use
silences
and
sentence
fragments
and
menacing
stares
,
almost
to
the
exclusion
of
what
we
previously
understood
to
be
theatrical
dialogue
.

When
``
The
Homecoming
''
was
first
produced
on
this
side
of
the
Atlantic
,
actors
and
directors
were
reverential
.

Silences
were
lengthy
--
nobody
moved
or
gestured
.

Nobody
smiled
onstage
,
and
nobody
in
the
audience
was
encouraged
to
laugh
.

This
kind
of
theater
was
new
to
us
.

Also
,
it
was
not
a
funny
time
over
here
,
what
with
the
Vietnam
War
,
the
'68
Democratic
convention
,
assassinations
and
riots
.

But
under
Jerry
Perry
's
direction
the
current
Steppenwolf
production
,
scheduled
to
play
through
Nov.
19
,
breaks
through
the
flat
and
boring
ritual
that
``
The
Homecoming
''
had
become
.

Led
by
a
near-perfect
performance
by
Alan
Wilder
as
Max
,
the
father
,
the
play
is
at
once
an
appalling
and
hilarious
dissection
of
a
family
's
rage
,
bitterness
,
fear
and
isolation
.

Encouraged
by
Mr.
Wilder
's
sly
grins
,
embarrassed
grimaces
and
sputtering
rages
,
the
audience
gets
the
joke
and
begins
to
laugh
before
the
end
of
the
first
act
.

Three
of
the
family
members
,
Max
and
his
two
sons
,
Lenny
and
Joey
,
live
off
the
flesh
:
Max
is
a
retired
butcher
,
Lenny
a
pimp
and
Joey
an
aspiring
boxer
.

Sam
,
Max
's
brother
,
has
escaped
the
flesh
by
working
as
a
liveried
chauffeur
and
never
seeking
a
wife
.

Teddy
,
the
eldest
of
Max
's
sons
,
has
made
the
most
dramatic
escape
by
becoming
a
professor
of
philosophy
at
an
American
university
.

Though
it
's
clearly
Max
's
wife
who
held
sway
here
until
her
death
,
now
none
of
the
other
male
residents
of
this
misbegotten
household
can
challenge
Max
.

The
play
concerns
Teddy
's
homecoming
with
his
wife
of
six
years
,
Ruth
.

Curiously
,
Randall
Arney
as
Teddy
seems
the
only
cast
member
unable
to
get
beyond
the
zombie
approach
to
a
Pinter
character
.

As
Ruth
,
Moira
Harris
,
a
large
and
beautiful
woman
who
may
be
our
next
Colleen
Dewhurst
,
begins
almost
immediately
to
overpower
each
of
the
men
.

In
the
end
,
Teddy
returns
alone
to
America
,
leaving
Ruth
in
Max
's
chair
.

We
have
seen
her
develop
within
a
few
hours
from
a
shy
and
unknown
in-law
to
a
goddess
of
the
flesh
who
will
replace
the
dead
mother
,
and
then
some
.

While
Steppenwolf
was
in
London
with
``
The
Grapes
of
Wrath
,
''
Bruce
Sagan
,
the
president
of
its
board
of
directors
,
quietly
returned
to
Chicago
to
buy
a
piece
of
real
estate
in
the
city
's
rapidly
reviving
North
Halsted
Street
restaurant
and
theater
district
.

Within
a
year
he
hopes
Steppenwolf
will
move
into
a
new
500-seat
theater
on
that
site
.

The
troupe
currently
performs
in
a
converted
dairy
that
seats
211
and
provides
little
capacity
for
staging
anything
beyond
a
simple
one-set
production
.

``
If
we
wanted
to
stage
`
Death
of
a
Salesman
,
'
``
Mr.
Sagan
says
,
``
Willie
Loman
would
have
to
live
in
a
ranch
house
because
of
the
low
ceiling
.
''

Steppenwolf
needs
the
extra
seats
even
more
than
the
fly
space
.

It
's
currently
forced
to
turn
away
many
potential
subscribers
beyond
the
13,000
who
can
be
accommodated
in
its
present
digs
.

For
all
the
attention
that
Chicago
theater
has
received
during
the
past
decade
,
not
one
new
building
has
been
devoted
to
it
.

Mr.
Sagan
,
a
former
publisher
and
real
estate
developer
,
has
put
together
an
$
8
million
financial
package
that
includes
approximately
$
4
million
of
tax
exempt
bonds
issued
by
the
State
of
Illinois
(
the
first
time
that
a
state
has
used
its
educational
facilities
authority
to
support
construction
of
a
theater
)
,
and
approximately
$
1
million
in
grants
from
the
National
Endowment
for
the
Arts
,
the
MacArthur
Foundation
,
and
a
few
other
deep
pockets
.

The
rest
,
he
is
confident
,
can
be
raised
.

His
board
members
alone
have
pledged
$
800,000
and
he
is
just
beginning
to
massage
local
foundations
and
corporations
.

Mr.
Sagan
compares
the
importance
of
Steppenwolf
with
Orson
Welles
's
Mercury
Theater
in
the
'30s
.

But
Welles
's
theater
company
turned
out
to
have
a
brief
--
one
might
say
a
mercurial
--
existence
.

What
will
Mr.
Sagan
do
with
his
new
theater
building
if
the
allure
of
Hollywood
and
Broadway
proves
too
much
for
such
Steppenwolf
stalwarts
as
John
Malkovich
(
``
Dangerous
Liaisons
''
)
,
Joan
Allen
(
``
The
Heidi
Chronicles
''
)
,
and
Glenne
Headly
(
``
Lonesome
Dove
''
)
,
and
the
company
crumbles
?

``
That
's
OK
,
''
Mr.
Sagan
replies
.

``
Let
this
building
be
Steppenwolf
's
legacy
to
Chicago
theater
.

After
enduring
three
days
of
heavy
selling
,
the
beleaguered
Nasdaq
over-the-counter
market
finally
rebounded
,
rising
sharply
in
hearty
trading
.

The
Nasdaq
Composite
Index
jumped
0.7
%
,
or
3.35
,
to
463.28
.

It
rose
more
than
the
New
York
Stock
Exchange
Composite
,
which
improved
0.2
%
.

Among
bigger
stocks
,
the
Nasdaq
100
Index
rose
1
%
,
or
4.56
,
to
453.05
,
while
the
Dow
Jones
Industrial
Average
was
up
0.2
%
.

Richard
Bruno
,
head
of
OTC
trading
at
PaineWebber
,
said
the
OTC
market
has
a
habit
of
lagging
big
moves
on
the
New
York
Stock
Exchange
.

While
the
industrial
average
rallied
on
Monday
following
last
Friday
's
collapse
,
the
OTC
market
,
which
did
n't
suffer
too
badly
during
the
correction
,
tumbled
.

``
Our
market
got
hit
a
lot
harder
on
Monday
than
the
listed
market
,
''
Mr.
Bruno
said
.

``
We
're
just
recovering
and
getting
back
to
business
as
usual
.

I
'm
encouraged
by
the
action
.
''

The
trading
pace
was
busy
,
with
4,343
issues
and
147.6
million
shares
changing
hands
.

Advancing
issues
beat
declining
ones
,
1,271
to
811
.

Much
of
the
jockeying
by
OTC
traders
and
investors
centered
on
shares
of
companies
that
might
be
financially
affected
by
damage
from
the
devastating
earthquake
in
northern
California
.

As
investors
speculated
about
the
long
-
and
short-term
implications
,
shares
of
a
number
of
companies
that
might
either
profit
or
face
problems
because
of
the
disaster
were
actively
traded
.

Heading
the
list
:
insurance
,
construction
and
technology
companies
located
in
the
San
Francisco
Bay
Area
.

Insurance-related
stocks
were
mixed
as
investors
tried
to
figure
out
how
to
assess
the
impact
of
the
property
damage
and
deaths
on
those
concerns
.

Traders
said
property-casualty
companies
with
the
heaviest
exposure
in
the
San
Francisco
area
include
the
OTC
's
Safeco
and
Ohio
Casualty
.

Frank
Gilmartin
,
a
trader
who
follows
insurance
stocks
for
Fox-Pitt
Kelton
,
said
his
strategy
was
to
sell
early
.

Then
,
if
the
stocks
fell
sharply
,
he
planned
to
begin
buying
them
aggressively
,
on
the
theory
that
the
companies
that
insure
against
property
damage
and
accidents
will
have
to
raise
rates
eventually
to
compensate
for
the
claims
they
will
pay
to
earthquake
victims
and
victims
of
last
month
's
Hurricane
Hugo
.

As
well
,
reinsurers
and
insurance
brokerage
companies
will
have
improved
profits
.

Many
investors
expected
damage
from
the
hurricane
to
be
the
catalyst
for
higher
rates
in
the
industry
,
which
has
been
depressed
because
of
low
rates
arising
from
intense
competition
.

But
Mr.
Gilmartin
said
the
hurricane
damage
was
n't
extensive
enough
to
prompt
premium
boosts
.

``
The
companies
just
gave
back
what
they
had
reserved
for
,
''
he
said
.

``
Now
,
they
'll
have
to
increase
their
coffers
to
protect
for
the
future
and
that
means
rate
increases
.
''

Overall
OTC
insurance
issues
were
mixed
.

Safeco
fell
1\/8
to
32
5\/8
on
462,900
shares
.

Ohio
Casualty
rose
1\/4
to
51
3\/4
on

shares
.

St.

Cos.
jumped

shares
.

Academy
Insurance
fell
1\/32
to
1
3\/16
;
but
volume
totaled
1.2
million
shares
.

The
Nasdaq
Insurance
Index
jumped
4.15
to
529.32
on
the
day
,
while
the
barometer
of
big
insurance
and
banking
issues
climbed
1.72
to
455.29
.

Investors
expect
SunGard
Data
Systems
,
a
company
that
provides
disaster
recovery
services
for
computer-dependent
businesses
,
to
profit
from
the
earthquake
.

SunGard
's
stock
rose
1
3\/4
to
21
1\/4
on
194,000
shares
.

Shares
of
Kasler
,
a
California
road
and
bridge
builder
,
were
heavily
traded
,
jumping
2
1\/8
to
9
7\/8
on
1.3
million
shares
.

Guy
F.
Atkinson
added
7\/8
to
16
7\/8
,
on
335,700
shares
.

The
company
,
based
in
San
Francisco
,
provides
industrial
infrastructure
engineering
and
construction
services
.

Traders
were
initially
nervous
about
shares
of
companies
,
including
many
leading
OTC
computer
companies
,
such
as
Apple
Computer
with
offices
in
the
vicinity
of
the
area
damaged
by
the
quake
.

But
most
of
those
stocks
fared
well
.

Apple
Computer
gained
1
to
48
1\/4
;
Ashton-Tate
rose
3\/8
to
10
3\/8
.

Intel
also
added
3\/8
to
33
7\/8
.

But
Sun
Microsystems
slipped
1\/4
to
17
1\/4
.

Shares
of
biotechnology
companies
in
the
area
were
also
higher
.

Chiron
was
up
1\/2
to
27
and
Cetus
gained
1\/2
to
16
3\/8
.

The
stocks
of
computer-related
companies
located
outside
California
improved
,
too
.

Microsoft
advanced
1
7\/8
to
80
1\/2
and
Lotus
Development
added
1
1\/4
to
32
1\/2
.

In
other
earthquake-related
news
,
Hambrecht
&
Quist
's
OTC
market
makers
were
excused
from
trading
yesterday
and
its
positions
were
frozen
for
the
day
by
the
National

Dealers
.

Power
could
n't
be
restored
at
the

's
San

headquarters
to
allow

yesterday
morning
.

In
New

,
Roger
Killion
,
a
Hambrecht
executive
vice
president
,
said
he
expects
OTC
trading
at
the
company
to
resume
this
morning
,
either
in
New

or
in
San
Francisco
.

In
other
trading
,
Medco
Containment
Services
gained
7\/8
to
15
on
1.9
million
shares
after
reporting
a
loss
for
the
first
quarter
,
which
ended
Sept.
30
.

The
company
earned
$
6.6
million
in
the
year-earlier
quarter
.

Jaguar
's
American
depositary
receipts
added
3\/8
to
10
3\/4
on
volume
of
1.1
million
.

Analysts
in
London
believe
investors
,
despite
their
stampede
to
dump
takeover
stocks
,
should
hold
on
tight
to
their
Jaguar
shares
,
this
newspaper
's
Heard
on
the
Street
column
said
yesterday
.

Amgen
rose
1
1\/2
to
50
3\/4
in
heavy
trading
.

Analysts
figure
Amgen
could
benefit
as
a
result
of
troubles
facing
its
competitor
,
Genetics
Institute
,
over
the
anti-anemia
drug
EPO
.

Genetics
Institute
disclosed
recently
that
it
is
embroiled
in
a
dispute
with
Boehringer
Mannheim
,
which
distributes
the
drug
,
regarding
the
usability
of
some
batches
.

Ciba-Geigy
Ltd.
and
Chiron
Corp.
said
they
extended
their
offer
for
Connaught
BioSciences
Inc.
,
valued
at
866
million
Canadian
dollars
(
US$
736
million
)
to
Oct.
27
.

The
companies
earlier
said
they
did
n't
want
to
raise
their
offer
to
match
a
rival
bid
by
Institut
Merieux
S.A.
of
C$
37
a
share
,
or
C$
942
million
.

But
they
said
the
C$
30-a-share
bid
,
which
was
due
to
expire
Monday
,
may
still
be
extended
or
varied
.

Merieux
,
a
vaccine
manufacturer
based
in
Lyon
,
France
,
is
51%-held
by
French
state-owned
Rhone-Poulenc
S.A
.

Ciba-Geigy
is
a
major
pharmaceutical
concern
based
in
Basel
,
Switzerland
.

Chiron
,
another
pharmaceutical
concern
,
is
based
in
Emeryville
,
Calif
.

Connaught
is
a
biotechnology
research
and
vaccine
manufacturing
concern
.

Institut
Merieux
's
bid
for
Toronto-based
Connaught
has
run
into
problems
with
the
Canadian
government
,
which
told
Merieux
last
week
that
it
was
n't
convinced
that
the
proposed
acquisition
would
be
of
``
net
benefit
''
to
Canada
.

Merieux
officials
are
expected
to
meet
with
federal
officials
in
Ottawa
today
to
discuss
the
decision
.

Within
minutes
after
the
stock
market
closed
Friday
,
I
called
Sen.
Bill
Bradley
of
New
Jersey
,
advised
him
that
the
Dow
Jones
Industrial
Average
had
declined
by
190
points
late
that
afternoon
,
and
cheerfully
informed
him
that
he
and
his
fellow
Democrats
were
to
blame
.

They
had
dealt
a
major
setback
that
afternoon
to
President
Bush
's
capital-gains
tax
cut
proposal
,
which
had
seemed
in
the
bag
after
it
passed
the
House
overwhelmingly
earlier
in
the
month
.

Sen.
Bradley
has
it
in
his
mind
that
such
a
tax
cut
would
unravel
the
tax
reform
he
helped
engineer
in
1986
.

But
he
knows
that
as
many
as
20
of
his
fellow
Democrats
are
disposed
to
vote
for
the
cut
,
popular
among
their
constituents
.

As
a
result
,
he
took
the
lead
in
arguing
that
the
cut
should
be
blocked
on
procedural
grounds
.

He
helped
persuade
10
of
these
senators
to
support
him
and
Majority
Leader
George
Mitchell
on
these
grounds
.

The
budget
reconciliation
had
to
be
dealt
with
by
the
Oct.
15
deadline
,
and
these
Senate
Democrats
refused
to
agree
to
allow
a
vote
to
append
capital
gains
to
the
budget
bill
,
knowing
it
would
pass
.

Denied
a
vote
on
substance
,
the
GOP
leadership
in
the
Senate
on
Friday
morning
was
confronted
with
a
hard
choice
.

It
could
throw
in
the
towel
and
hope
to
win
on
capital
gains
late
this
month
,
or
it
could
follow
the
White
House
strategy
,
to
veto
reconciliation
unless
capital
gains
was
appended
.

The
U.S.
Chamber
of
Commerce
has
been
in
the
forefront
in
supporting
the
Bush
proposal
.

It
endorsed
the
White
House
strategy
,
believing
it
to
be
the
surest
way
to
victory
.

At
noon
Friday
,
a
senior
White
House
official
advised
Richard
Rahn
,
the
Chamber
's
chief
economist
,
that
the
White
House
would
not
agree
to
a
budget
reconciliation
bill
unless
it
had
firm
assurances
that
a
vote
on
substance
would
be
permitted
in
the
Senate
.

Two
hours
later
,
the
first
word
emerged
on
Capitol
Hill
that
the
administration
had
agreed
to
reconciliation
with
no
such
assurances
from
Senate
Democrats
.

Mr.
Rahn
was
shocked
,
telephoning
the
office
of
Richard
Darman
,
director
of
the
Office
of
Management
and
Budget
,
and
the
administration
's
chief
strategist
on
this
issue
.

He
left
a
message
accusing
Mr.
Darman
of
selling
out
.

It
was
the
Senate
Republicans
,
though
,
who
had
edged
away
from
the
veto
strategy
.

The
stock
market
reacted
as
Mr.
Rahn
did
,
crumbling
as
it
absorbed
the
news
that
Mr.
Darman
's
strategy
had
been
abandoned
.

The
stock
market
,
after
all
,
represents
the
collective
expectations
about
the
value
of
the
future
income
stream
of
the
nation
's
capital
stock
,
discounted
to
present
value
.

Why
should
it
be
so
surprising
that
a
30
%
cut
in
the
capital-gains
tax
would
have
such
an
enormous
impact
on
the
value
of
the
nation
's
capital
stock
?

The
total
value
of
privately
held
assets
is
easily
more
than
$
15
trillion
.

The
value
traded
on
the
exchanges
is
close
to
$
3
trillion
.

If
the
tax
on
any
gain
to
those
assets
was
doubled
,
would
n't
the
value
fall
to
the
owners
of
the
assets
?

Is
n't
it
reasonable
to
assume
that
the
asset
you
own
would
be
worth
more
if
the
government
suddenly
announced
that
if
you
sold
it
,
you
would
be
able
to
keep
30
%
more
of
its
gain
than
you
previously
believed
?

Indeed
,
the
stock
market
's
steady
advance
this
year
tracked
with
President
Bush
's
success
in
advancing
his
capital-gains
proposal
.

A
30
%
cut
in
this
year
's
capital
gains
alone
amounts
to
roughly
$
50
billion
.

We
're
talking
real
money
.

When
Richard
Rahn
advised
the
financial
press
that
the
market
crash
was
caused
by
the
setback
to
capital
gains
,
he
was
generally
ignored
and
mildly
ridiculed
.

Instead
,
the
press
corps
readily
accepted
the
notion
that
a
snag
in
the
takeover
financing
of
United
Airlines
instantly
knocked
7
%
off
the
value
of
the
nation
's
capital
stock
and
caused
convulsions
around
the
world
.

Mr.
Rahn
was
pointing
out
an
elephant
rumbling
through
Wall
Street
while
conventional
wisdom
had
fastened
on
the
UAL
flea
.

Why
is
this
happening
?

For
one
thing
,
quite
a
number
of
the
leading
spokesmen
on
Wall
Street
are
not
portfolio
managers
,
who
understand
that
the
value
of
assets
is
greatly
affected
by
how
government
taxes
those
assets
.

They
are
economists
and
financial
reporters
who
sympathize
with
the
view
that
a
capital-gains
tax
cut
benefits
the
rich
.

Yet
they
somehow
think
that
Wall
Street
is
indifferent
to
losing
the
tax
cut
that
seemed
so
close
Friday
morning
and
is
now
problematic
.

The
market
rebound
Monday
followed
weekend
assurances
from
Mr.
Darman
that
the
administration
has
other
plans
to
win
the
cut
,
which
is
alive
and
well
.

Sen.
Bradley
's
argument
is
that
a
capital-gains
tax
cut
would
be
bad
for
the
economy
in
the
longer
run
.

It
would
inevitably
lead
to
an
increase
in
marginal
income-tax
rates
in
1990
,
he
thinks
,
when
the
White
House
is
forced
to
ask
for
higher
taxes
to
meet
budget
targets
.

That
is
,
with
capital
gains
cut
,
the
glue
of
the
1986
accord
will
be
gone
,
and
political
realities
will
push
up
income-tax
rates
.

The
counter-argument
,
which
he
has
heard
,
is
that
if
he
and
his
fellow
Democrats
are
successful
in
killing
the
president
's
proposal
,
the
revenue
gap
will
open
up
tremendously
in
1990
because
of
the
weakened
economy
.

In
this
atmosphere
,
there
would
be
no
serious
consideration
of
tax
increases
.

If
Sen.
Bradley
would
permit
a
vote
on
capital
gains
,
though
,
it
would
pass
,
Christmas
retail
sales
would
be
strong
instead
of
burdened
by
a
falling
stock
market
,
the
1990
economy
would
be
robust
,
and
the
revenue
gains
at
every
level
of
government
,
including
New
Jersey
's
,
would
be
surprisingly
high
.

No
tax
increases
would
be
necessary
.

The
struggle
over
capital
gains
is
the
most
important
game
in
town

on

Street

Federal
prosecutors
said
they
have
obtained
a
guilty
plea
from
another
person
in
the
government
's
ongoing
probe
of
illegal
payments
in
the
record
industry
.

William
Craig
,
an
independent
record
promoter
,
pleaded
guilty
to
payola
and
criminal
tax
charges
,
according
to
a
statement
issued
by
Gary
Feess
,
the
U.S.
attorney
here
.

Payola
is
the
practice
of
making
illegal
,
undisclosed
payments
to
radio
station
personnel
in
return
for
getting
the
stations
to
play
certain
songs
over
the
air
.

As
part
of
his
plea
agreement
with
the
government
,
the
44-year-old
Mr.
Craig
faces
a
maximum
of
three
years
in
prison
.

In
return
,
Mr.
Craig
agreed
to
cooperate
in
the
government
's
continuing
payola
probe
,
says
a
spokeswoman
for
the
U.S.
attorney
's
office
.

Mr.
Craig
and
three
others
were
indicted
last
year
as
part
of
that
payola
probe
.

Two
other
defendants
previously
pleaded
guilty
,
and
charges
against
the
third
were
dropped
.

Authority
issued
$

billion
in

debt
offering
in

years
.

Proceeds
from
the

range
,
will
be
used
to
replace
bonds
with
an
average
interest
rate
of
13.1
%
.

The
TVA
said
the
refinancing
should
save
$
75
million
a
year
in
interest
payments
.

The
refinancing
is
part
of
the
TVA
's
strategy
of
dealing
with
what
has
been
an
intractable
problem
:
its
staggering
$
18.5
billion
debt
,
most
of
which
is
owed
to
the
Treasury
Department
's
Federal
Financing
Bank
.

The
TVA
currently
plans
to
issue
a
total
of
$
6.7
billion
in
bonds
to
refinance
its
high-interest
debt
.

The
$
4
billion
bond
issue
also
will
help
the
TVA
meet
its
goal
of
not
raising
rates
for
another
year
,
said
William
F.
Malec
,
the
agency
's
chief
financial
officer
.

The
bond
issue
is
TVA
's
first
public
offering
since
the
Financing
Bank
was
created
in
1974
,
primarily
to
finance
the
TVA
.

But
the
offering
almost
did
n't
happen
.

The
TVA
,
in
fact
,
decided
to
proceed
with
the
bond
offering
following
an
agreement
last
week
with
the
Financing
Bank
,
which
allows
TVA
to
keep
borrowing
short
term
from
the
bank
for
two
years
after
it
goes
to
the
public
market
.

The
Treasury
contended
that
TVA
could
n't
borrow
from
both
it
and
the
public
debt
market
.

The
$
4
billion
in
bonds
break
down
as
follows
:
$
1
billion
in
five-year
bonds
with
a
coupon
rate
of
8.25
%
and
a
yield
to
maturity
of
8.33
%
;
$
1
billion
in
10-year
bonds
with
a
coupon
rate
of
8.375
%
and
a
yield
to
maturity
of
8.42
%
;
$
2
billion
in
30-year
bonds
with
five-year
call
protection
,
a
coupon
rate
of
8.75

Mutual-fund
czar
John
M.
Templeton
has
put
his
money
where
his
moniker
is
,
pouring
$
1.4
million
into
one
of
his
own
funds
,
the
Templeton
Value
Fund
.

Mr.
Templeton
owns
shares
in
several
of
the
33
funds
that
his

manages
,
but
only
in
three
of
the
10
available
to
U.S.

the
Securities
and
Exchange
Commission
.

Those
are
Templeton
Global
Income
,
Templeton
Emerging
Markets
and
now
the
Value
Fund
.

Why
did
he
add
the
Value
Fund
to
the
list
?

Because
he
's
very
bullish
on
the
emerging
growth
stocks
that
make
up
the
fund
's
portfolio
,
Mr.
Templeton
said
from
his
Bahamas

``
Emerging
growth
stocks
have
n't
been
popular
in
America
for

,
they
've
been
neglected
,
''
he
said
,
and
their
prices
often
trail
the
market
as
a
whole
.

Mr.
Templeton
's
147,300-share
purchase
in
the
closed-end
fund
came
before
the
U.S.
stock
market
's

still
proved

In
one
of
the
first
indoor
air-pollution
cases
to
go
to
trial
,
a
state-court
jury
decided
in
favor
of
the
defendant
,
Burlington
Industries
Inc
.

The
verdict
,
reached
late
last
week
in
Cincinnati
,
may
end
an
eight-year
legal
battle
for
the
Greensboro
,
N.C.
,
carpet
maker
.

Glenn
and
Sharon
Beebe
of
Cincinnati
had
sued
the
com
-
pany
in
1981
after
installing
Burlington
carpets
in
their
office
.

The
Beebes
alleged
that
toxic
fumes
from
the
carpets
made
them
sick
.

As
a
result
of
their
illness
,
the
Beebes
said
,
they
lost
$
1.8
million
in
wages
and
earnings
.

In
addition
,
they
said
that
months
of
exposure
to
the
chemicals
has
left
them
sensitive
to
a
wide
range
of
commonly
used
substances
.

The
case
had
been
closely
watched
because
attorneys
anticipate
increasing
litigation
nationally
over
the
so-called
sick-building
syndrome
.

Plaintiffs
'
lawyers
say
that
buildings
become
``
sick
''
when
inadequate
fresh
air
and
poor
ventilation
systems
lead
pollutants
to
build
up
inside
.

Anthony
J.
Iaciofano
,
a
lawyer
for
Burlington
,
said
the
company
believes
the
Beebes
'
symptoms
were
not
related
to
the
carpeting
.

He
said
that
ill
effects
from
new
carpets
manifest
themselves
immediately
but
that
the
Beebes
'
symptoms
appeared
months
later
.

Catherine
Adams
,
the
Beebes
'
lawyer
,
said
the
verdict
would
not
discourage
other
plaintiffs
from
filing
such
suits
.

Scientists
are
only
beginning
to
understand
what
causes
sick-building
syndrome
and
much
of
that
research
was
unavailable
when
the
Beebes
filed
the
case
,
she
said
.

The
Beebes
now
believe
that
a
prime
culprit
for
their
injuries
was
fumes
from
an
adhesive
used
in
the
carpeting

But
the
Beebes
did
n't
come
to
that
conclusion
until
time
limits
had
elapsed
for
adding
the
adhesives
maker
as
a
defendant
in
the
case
,
Ms.
Adams
said
.

The
Beebes
have
not
yet
decided
whether
to
appeal
.

TIMES
SQUARE
development
opponents
are
dealt
setback
.

The
Appellate
Division
of
New
York
State
Supreme
Court
dismissed
six
lawsuits
attempting
to
block
a
$
2.5
billion
project
planned
for
42nd
Street
in
Manhattan
.

Opponents
of
the
project
had
claimed
that
the
city
and
the
state
of
New
York
,
which
are
co-sponsoring
the
project
,
had
failed
to
adhere
to
environmental
guidelines
.

All
but
two
of
the
40
or
so
lawsuits
that
have
been
filed
since
the
project
's
1984
approval
have
been
dismissed
before
the
trial
stage
.

The
two
that
remain
have
n't
yet
reached
the
pre-trial
fact-finding
stage
.

State
officials
said
the
court
's
ruling
clears
the
way
for
proceedings
to
condemn
buildings
in
the
area
.

``
This
project
is
ready
to
move
,
''
said
State
Urban
Development
Corp.
Chairman
Vincent
Tese
.

But
developers
of
four
planned
office
towers
cautioned
that
obstacles
still
remain
.

As
part
of
the
agreement
with
the
state
,
the
developers
--
a
partnership
of
Park
Tower
Realty
and
Prudential
Insurance
Co.
of
America
--
said
they
would
not
proceed
with
condemnation
proceedings
while
there
was
``
significant
litigation
''
pending
.

Park
Tower
General
Counsel
Matthew
Mayer
said
the
development
team
will
have
to
review
two
additional
lawsuits
before
putting
up
a
$
155
million
letter
of
credit
to
cover
condemnation
costs
.

Also
,
he
said
,
the
partnership
is
waiting
to
see
whether
the
appellate
division
's
ruling
will
be
appealed
.

The
plan
,
which
has
been
plagued
with
delays
and
business-related
setbacks
,
seeks
to
transform
the
area
from
a
seedy
thoroughfare
to
a
more
wholesome
office
and
theater
district
.

State
and
city
officials
are
still
negotiating
with
developers
to
renovate
historic
theaters
and
build
and
operate
a
merchandise
mart
and
hotel
.

FEDERAL
JUDGE
EXPANDS
role
of
U.S.
courts
in
extradition
decisions
.

U.S.
District
Judge
Jack
B.
Weinstein
of
Brooklyn
,
N.Y.
,
ruled
that
a
man
implicated
in
an
attack
on
an
Israeli
passenger
bus
in
1986
can
be
extradited
to
Israel
for
trial
.

A
magistrate
had
initially
refused
the
request
,
ruling
that
the
attack
had
been
a
political
act
for
which
the
man
,
Mahmoud
El-Abed
Ahmad
,
would
be
exempt
from
extradition
.

However
,
Judge
Weinstein
wrote
in
his
opinion
late
last
month
that
terrorism
and
acts
of
war
against
civilians
can
not
be
defined
as
political
acts
.

Judge
Weinstein
also
ruled
that
judges
must
consider
prior
to
extradition
whether
the
defendant
will
be
treated
fairly
in
a
foreign
court
.

To
do
so
,
the
judge
said
,
the
U.S.
courts
must
review
the
judicial
process
in
the
foreign
country
independently
of
the
State
Department
's
assessment
.

He
said
that
in
this
case
he
concurred
with
the
State
Department
's
decision
that
Mr.
Ahmad
should
be
extradited
.

Mr.
Ahmad
's
lawyer
said
he
would
appeal
.

Lawyers
close
to
the
case
said
they
believed
the
ruling
was
unprecedented
.

``
Up
until
now
the
courts
have
said
it
is
not
their
role
to
supervise
the
foreign
country
's
courts
,
''
said
Jacques
Semmelman
,
the
assistant
U.S.
attorney
on
the
case
.

QUOTABLE
:

In
a
speech
prepared
for
delivery
in
New
York
yesterday
,
retired
Justice
Lewis
Powell
contested
the
notion
that
the
last
Supreme
Court
term
marked
a
turn
toward
conservatism
:
``
Commentators
who
agreed
on
little
else
unanimously
proclaimed
a
`
shift
in
direction
'
on
the
court
...
.

I
take
these
pronouncements
,
like
many
that
have
preceded
them
in
past
years
,
with
a
grain
of
salt
.

In
an
era
of
`
sound
bites
'
and
instant
opinion
polls
it
is
dangerous
to
apply
broad
labels
to
a
single
term
.

(
During
its
centennial
year
,
The
Wall
Street
Journal
will
report
events
of
the
past
century
that
stand
as
milestones
of
American
business
history
.
)

THE
YOM
KIPPUR
WAR
,
WHEN
EGYPT
CRASHED
into
Israel
on
Oct.
6
,
1973
,
the
holiest
day
in
the
Jewish
calendar
,
lasted
barely
a
month
.

But
one
far-afield
effect
is
still
with
us
.

The
Arab
states
,
always
bitterly
resentful
of
U.S.
support
toward
Israel
,
realized
they
held
an
irresistable
weapon
--
oil
.

Early
in
October
,
six
Arab
nations
in
the
Persian
Gulf
jacked
up
prices
sharply
.

On
Oct.
22
,
led
by
Saudi
Arabia
,
the
world
's
largest
exporter
,
they
embargoed
oil
shipments
to
the
U.S.
and
to
the
Netherlands
,
Israel
's
staunchest
European
ally
.

The
timing
was
perfect
.

The
Arabs
had
tried
embargos
before
.

In
1956
,
when
Britain
,
France
and
Israel
invaded
Egypt
to
seize
the
Suez
Canal
,
Arab
producers
cut
off
supplies
to
Europe
.

Texas
simply
pumped
harder
.

U.S.
oil
supplies
,
however
,
had
peaked
in
1970
and
1971
and
by
1973
were
declining
.

Imports
,
then
six
million
barrels
a
day
,
came
primarily
from
Venezuela
and
Canada
.

But
Middle
East
supplies
were
growing
in
importance
.

By
1973
,
the
U.S.
was
bringing
in
two
million
barrels
of
Arab
oil
a
day
,
more
than
10
%
of
the
17.3
million
barrels
consumed
daily
.

Politics
and
economics
conspired
.

Japan
and
Europe
,
far
more
dependent
on
Mideast
oil
than
the
U.S.
,
would
n't
offend
the
Arabs
or
trade
off
their
precious
supplies
.

The
U.S.
did
manage
to
supply
the
Dutch
with
oil
by
relabeling
supplies
;
once
oil
is
shipped
,
no
one
can
tell
its
source
.

But
car-happy
Americans
panicked
,
and
so
did
the
U.S.
and
other
oil-consuming
governments
.

``
Shortage
''
and
``
crisis
''
became
buzz
words
,
although
neither
really
applied
.

The
spot
dislocations
that
showed
up
were
largely
the
result
of
confusion
(
much
of
it
in
Washington
)
,
though
that
was
cold
comfort
for
drivers
waiting
in
mile-long
lines
at
the
gas
pumps
.

The
embargo
lasted
only
six
months
,
but
the
price
hikes
became
a
fact
of
life
.

What
the
Arabs
started
,
inflation
finished
.

Once
and
for
all
,
$
5-a-barrel
crude
oil
and
35-cents-a-gallon
gasoline
were
history
.

Times
may
be
tough
on
Wall
Street
for
some
,
but
a
few
bosses
are
making
as
much
as
ever
--
or
more
.

At
Bear
Stearns
Cos.
,
for
example
,
the
15
executive
officers
led
by
Chairman
Alan
``
Ace
''
Greenberg
got
a
pay
increase
to
$
35.9
million
for
the
14-month
period
ended
June
30
from
$
22.9
million
for
the
12
months
ended
April
30
,
1988
.

The
figures
do
n't
include
substantial
dividends
on
holdings
of
Bear
Stearns
stock
.

Mr.
Greenberg
himself
was
paid
$
4.5
million
,
before
an
estimated
$
1.5
million
in
dividends
,
up
from
$
2.4
million
the
year
before
.

The
increase
is
noted
in
the
brokerage
firm
's
latest
proxy
statement
filed
with
the
Securities
and
Exchange
Commission
.

Because
it
operates
on
a
fiscal
year
,
Bear
Stearns
's
yearly
filings
are
available
much
earlier
than
those
of
other
firms
.

The
latest
period
includes
14
months
instead
of
12
because
Bear
Stearns
changed
to
a
fiscal
year
ending
in
June
instead
of
April
.

Meanwhile
,
Bear
Stearns
's
650
stock
and
bond
salesmen
saw
thinner
paychecks
over
the
past
year
,
which
the
company
says
reflected
lower
commission
revenue
caused
by
a
decline
in
investor
activity
in
the
markets
.

However
,
Bear
Stearns
on
Monday
reported
improved
earnings
for
its
first
quarter
,
ended
Sept.
29
,
partly
because
of
a
31
%
increase
in
commissions
during
the
quarter
.

William
J.
Montgoris
,
chief
financial
officer
,
defended
the
lofty
salaries
at
Bear
Stearns
.

``
All
of
us
are
on
a
base
salary
of
$
200,000
if
the
firm
makes
nothing
--
and
that
's
pretty
low
as
far
as
Wall
Street
goes
,
''
Mr.
Montgoris
said
.

However
,
Bear
Stearns
has
never
had
an
unprofitable
year
since
its
founding
65
years
ago
.

Four
Bear
Stearns
executives
besides
the
62-year-old
Mr.
Greenberg
were
paid
$
3
million
or
more
before
dividends
for
the
14
months
ended
in
June
.

According
to
the
proxy
statement
,
James
E.
Cayne
,
55
,
Bear
Stearns
's
president
,
made
$
3.9
million
;
an
executive
vice
president
,
Michael
L.
Tarnopol
,
53
,
made
nearly
$
3.4
million
;
and
two
executive
vice
presidents
,
Vincent
J.
Mattone
,
44
,
and
William
J.
Michaelcheck
,
42
,
made
about
$
3.3
million
each
.

Mr.
Montgoris
said
the
firm
has
a
``
straight
mathematical
formula
''
for
determining
compensation
,
based
on
the
firm
's
earnings
.

``
Just
because
a
particular
element
of
the
firm
is
down
,
''
such
as
stockbrokerage
,
``
does
n't
mean
the
executive
committee
should
be
paid
less
,
''
he
said
.

Morgan
Grenfell
Group
PLC
said
John
Craven
,
group
chief
executive
officer
,
is
taking
over
the
chairmanship
of
the
merchant
banking
group
from
Sir
Peter
Carey
,
who
is
retiring
.

Mr.
Carey
will
remain
a
member
of
the
merchant
bank
's
board
.

Mr.
Craven
is
widely
credited
with
refocusing
Morgan
Grenfell
's
energies
on
its
core
corporate
finance
,
fund
management
and
banking
activities
over
the
past
year
.

Last
year
,
Morgan
Grenfell
shut
down
its
ailing
U.K.
securities
operations
.

Mr.
Craven
said
his
move
to
the
chairmanship
means
he
will
take
a
less
active
role
in
the
day-to-day
management
of
the
group
,
but
he
added
that
the
merchant
bank
's
strategic
focus
remains
unchanged
.

Mr.
Craven
joined
Morgan
Grenfell
as
group
chief
executive
in
May
1987
,
a
few
months
after
the
resignations
of
former
Chief
Executive
Christopher
Reeves
and
other
top
officials
because
of
the
merchant
bank
's
role
in
Guinness
PLC
's
controversial
takeover
of
Distiller
's
Co.
in
1986
.

Morgan
Grenfell
had
advised
Guinness
on
the
bid
,
which
was
surrounded
by
allegations
that
Guinness
used
artificial
means
to
support
the
bid
's
value
.

Morgan
Grenfell
said
Michael
Dobson
,
currently
group
deputy
chief
executive
,
will
assume
the
chief
executive
position
.

The
merchant
bank
also
announced
that
finance
director
David
Eward
is
taking
early
retirement
for
personal
reasons
.

His
duties
will
be
taken
over
by
Anthony
Richmond-Watson
,
who
has
been
elected
deputy
chairman
.

News
of
Mr.
Eward
's
retirement
comes
one
day
after
Morgan
said
that
Christopher
Whittington
resigned
as
chairman
of
Morgan
's
banking
subsidiary
to
join
a
financial
services
firm
.

Mr.
Craven
said
both
Messrs.
Eward
and
Whittington
had
planned
to
leave
the
bank
earlier
,
but
Mr.
Craven
had
persuaded
them
to
remain
until
the
bank
was
in
a
healthy
position
.

``
If
there
's
any
coincidence
about
the
departures
it
's
that
they
are
leaving
at
a
time
when
the
business
is
in
reasonably
good
shape
and
going
forward
very
well
.

Morgan
Grenfell
announced
its
pretax
profit
rose
49.6

Par
Pharmaceutical
Inc.
said
it
named
its
interim
president
and
chief
executive
officer
,
Kenneth
I.
Sawyer
,
to
those
posts
permanently
,
and
elected
him
to
the
board
.

Par
also
said
it
was
advised
by
the
U.S.
attorney
for
Maryland
that
it
is
one
of
a
number
of
companies
being
investigated
by
a
federal
grand
jury
for
alleged
violations
of
the
federal
Food
,
Drug
and
Cosmetic
Act
.

Par
,
a
generic-drug
maker
that
has
been
plagued
by
management
problems
,
was
already
the
subject
of
a
federal
criminal
inquiry
into
the
drug-approval
process
and
a
Food
and
Drug
Administration
investigation
.

A
Par
spokesman
said
he
understood
the
criminal
investigation
in
Maryland
relates
to
matters
Par
disclosed
in
July
,
when
Par
said
it
filed
false
drug
information
with
the
FDA
.

At
the
time
,
the
company
said
it
was
recalling
one
of
its
drugs
and
had
stopped
selling
two
others
.

The
spokesman
said
he
also
understood
that
the
inquiry
related
to
the
existence
of
an
``
off-the-record
''
production
book
.

The
book
noted
changes
made
at
the
manufacturing
level
that
were
n't
disclosed
to
the
FDA
.

Par
said
it
is
cooperating
in
the
investigation
.

Also
yesterday
,
Ashok
Patel
,
a
former
Par
official
who
pleaded
guilty
to
providing
an
FDA
employee
an
illegal
gratuity
of
$
3,000
,
was
sentenced
by
a
federal
judge
in
Baltimore
to
one
year
of
community
service
and
a
$
150,000
fine
.

Mr.
Patel
also
was
placed
on
three
years
'
probation
.

Mr.
Patel
resigned
as
senior
vice
president
of
Par
in
April
.

In
July
,
Par
and
a
60%-owned
unit
agreed
to
plead
guilty
in
that
inquiry
,
as
did
another
former
Par
official
.

Mr.
Sawyer
began
running
the
company
on
an
interim
basis
in
late
September
.

Par
said
it
selected
him
for
the
posts
of
president
and
chief
executive
on
a
permanent
basis
because
of
his
experience
in
the
industry
and
his
performance
at
Par
.

Perry
Levine
,
chairman
,
said
Mr.
Sawyer
had
``
taken
significant
steps
''
to
restore
the
company
's
credibility
and
sense
of
professionalism
and
integrity
.

Just
after
midnight
Monday
,
federal
spending
started
to
drop
by
$
16
billion
.

What
do
you
say
we
all
close
down
the
poker
game
,
go
home
and
bank
the
$
16
billion
?

That
's
essentially
what
budget
director
Richard
Darman
is
suggesting
,
and
we
think
he
deserves
as
much
support
as
he
can
get
.

If
human
beings
ca
n't
cut
federal
spending
honestly
--
and
they
ca
n't
--
let
the
computers
do
it
.

Congress
,
with
a
measure
of
White
House
complicity
,
has
been
manipulating
the
spending
accounts
for
years
under
the
cover
of
omnibus
appropriations
bills
.

(
Indeed
without
earlier
manipulations
,
the
current
sequester
of
$
16
billion
would
have
been
even
larger
.
)

We
suspect
voters
are
fed
up
with
the
finagling
.

Consider
,
for
instance
,
that
even
yesterday
's
widely
publicized
sequester
is
likely
to
be
traduced
if
business
as
usual
is
allowed
to
prevail
.

Under
the
law
,
Gramm-Rudman
's
across-the-board-cuts
in
federal
programs
are
supposed
to
be
permanent
.

Social
Security
and
spending
for
poor
people
are
exempted
.

However
,
the
Associated
Press
's
account
of
the
Monday
sequester
order
signed
by
President
Bush
neatly
captured
the
contempt
Congress
shows
toward
the
notion
of
a
legally
binding
commitment
:

``
Lawmakers
have
been
saying
for
weeks
that
they
plan
to
roll
back
the
cuts
as
soon
as
they
agree
to
a
compromise
on
a
deficit-cutting
bill
.
''

Mr.
Darman
's
inclination
to
save
the
sequester
was
backed
up
yesterday
by
White
House
Press
Secretary
Marlin
Fitzwater
:

``
There
is
some
feeling
here
that
the
cuts
are
the
way
to
go
.

It
will
reduce
spending
in
a
very
effective
fashion
.
''

This
attitude
is
being
waved
away
by
sophisticates
around
Washington
as
little
more
than
tough
talk
.

It
looks
to
us
like
a
golden
opportunity
for
George
Bush
to
chop
off
at
the
knees
all
this
talk
about
a
timid
,
unserious
presidency
.

Mr.
Bush
would
be
acting
in
the
public
interest
if
he
let
the
Washington
elites
who
manipulate
these
budgets
--
the
bureaucrats
,
the
lobbyists
,
the
congressional
staffers
--
live
for
just
one
year
on
a
restricted
diet
.

Ask
Tommy
Lasorda
;
thin
is
in
.

Senator
Phil
Gramm
pointed
out
Monday
that
in
the
20
years
before
Gramm-Rudman
was
enacted
in
1985
,
federal
spending
grew
by
about
11
%
a
year
;
since
the
law
,
it
's
grown
at
under
5
%
annually
.

Another
major
factor
in
this
positive
trend
was
Ronald
Reagan
's
decision
early
in
his
presidency
to
fight
the
budget
war
on
the
expenditure
side
rather
than
raising
taxes
.

George
Bush
's
continued
support
of
the
tax
dam
sustains
this
strategy
of
pressuring
Congress
to
make
choices
among
competing
priorities
,
rather
than
just
saying
yes
to
all
the
grateful
special-interest
constituencies
that
fill
the
PAC
trough
.

If
Washington
's
elites
ever
succeed
in
bursting
the
tax
dam
,
Americans
will
be
engulfed
in
a
red
sea
of
new
spending
programs
,
such
as
federalized
child
care
.

Child
care
was
one
of
the
many
``
extraneous
''
bills
pulled
out
of
the
Senate
's
reconciliation
bill
last
Friday
.

Others
were
the
capital-gains
cut
,
Section
89
repeal
,
the
disabled
workers
bill
,
and
the
unprecedented
reconsideration
of
the
catastrophic
health
act
.

All
this
stuff
still
is
in
the
House
's
1,878-page
reconciliation
bill
,
and
many
Members
say
they
're
reluctant
to
pull
out
cherished
bills
,
just
to
see
them
die
.

Republicans
especially
want
a
guarantee
from
the
House
leadership
that
they
'll
get
an
up-or-down
vote
on
the
bills
.

House
Speaker
Foley
ought
to
deliver
that
promise
.

This
is
the
way
government
is
supposed
to
work
,
with
politicians
taking
responsibility
for
votes
that
their
constituents
can
identify
,
instead
of
concealing
them
in
the
great
reconciliation
garbage
truck
.

We
have
as
much
nostalgia
as
anyone
for
those
leafy
,
breezy
days
in
Washington
when
honorable
men
and
women
dickered
over
budgets
and
even
log-rolled
a
bit
to
see
that
the
bridges
got
build
,
roads
paved
,
soldiers
paid
or
that
the
desperately
poor
were
cared
for
.

Those
days
are
gone
.

Nor
do
we
see
any
reason
to
believe
that
a
metropolitan
Washington
that
has
gotten
fat
and
rich
and
lazy
in
the
shadow
of
the
federal
colossus
will
change
much
on
its
own
initiative
.

Save
the
sequester
,
and
let
Washington
scream
.

takeover
bids
,
but
said
it
's
not
aware
of

Under

's
plan
,
shareholders
were
issued
rights
that
,
in

event
of
certain
attempted
takeovers
,
allow

to

in

company
at

National

unit
in
periodic
,
open-market

shares
are
about
23

of
Interferon
's
common
shares
outstanding
,
excluding
National

.

Noting
the
recent

approval

Japanese
investors
,
reassured
by
Monday
's
strong
rally
on

,
erased
most
of

on
the
Tokyo
Stock
Exchange
.

But
analysts
said
the
rebound
did
n't
remove
the
cautious
mood
from
the
market
.

In
London
,
stocks
closed
lower
in
volatile
trading
as
an
opening
rally
was
obliterated
by
worse-than-expected
U.S.

figures
.

Paris

had
a

reaction
,
but

European
bourses
posted
gains
,
as
did
all
major
Asian
and
Pacific
stock

Tokyo
's
Nikkei

of

The
rise
came
a
day
after
the
year
's
biggest
drop
on
Monday
,
when
the
Nikkei
fell
647.33
,
or
1.8

,
in

to
Friday

6.9
%
plunge
on

In

trading
Wednesday
in

,
the

Japanese

back

,
analysts
said
.

Foreign
investors
reportedly
started
off
selling
but
later
joined
in
the
buying
.

The
Tokyo
rally
seemed
to
confirm
the
view
,
frequently
expressed
in
Japan
in
the
past
few
days
,
that
the
drop
in
New

was
a
local
problem

to
merger

``
Nothing
has
changed
fundamentally
in
the
Tokyo
market
.
''

But
even
though
Tokyo
appears
unharmed
by
recent
market
volatility
,
analysts
and
traders
say
there
are
still
a
few
concerns
on
the
horizon
.

In
particular
,
Japanese
investors
will
be
keeping
a
wary
eye
on
Wall
Street
to
see
whether
Monday
's
88.12-point
rally
holds
up
as
fresh
U.S.
economic
data
are
released
.

``
People
are
placing
small
bets
.

There
's
no
huge
buying
,
''
said
Stephen
Hill
,
head
of
equity
sales
at
Jardine
Fleming
Securities
Ltd.
in
Tokyo
.

``
Really
brave
views
right
now
would
be
foolhardy
.
''

Yesterday
's
buyers
favored
real
estate
,
construction
and
other
large-capitalization
issues
,
reflecting
the
fact
that
many
Tokyo
investors
now
feel
safer
with
domestically
oriented
stocks
,
analysts
said
.

They
also
are
concerned
about
the
persistent
strength
of
the
dollar
against
the
yen
,
as
a
weaker
yen
leads
to
higher
import
prices
in
Japan
and
adds
to
domestic
inflationary
pressures
.

Currency
concerns
also
weigh
heavily
on
interest
rate-sensitive
stocks
such
as
banking
and
other
financial
issues
because
of
fears
that
Japanese
interest
rates
might
have
to
rise
to
keep
the
dollar
in
check
.

Among
steel
shares
,
NKK
rose
19
to
705
yen
(
$
4.97

a
share
,
and
Nippon
Steel
gained
17
to

.

Construction
shares
that
gained
included
Shimizu
,
which
rose
130
to
2,080
.

In
the
real

sector
,
Mitsui
Real
Estate
Development
was
up
100
at

and
Mitsubishi

London
's
Financial
Times-Stock
Exchange
100-share
index
fell
27.9
points
to
2135.5
.

It
was
down
more
than
40
points
a
half-hour
before
the
close
,
marking
a
61.5-point
turnaround
from
its
high
,
reached
in
the
first
15
minutes
of
trading
.

The
narrower
Financial
Times
30-share
index
fell
29.6
to
1730.7
.

Volume
was
an
active
643.3
million

,
about
double
the
recent

down
from
959.3
million
the
previous
day
,
which
U.K.
traders
have
dubbed
``

.
''

Prices
opened
strongly
on
the
basis
of
Monday
's
Wall
Street
rally
and
yesterday
's
gains
in
Tokyo
.

But
the
advance
faltered
as
index-options
traders
and
investors
jittery
about
the
U.K.
economic
outlook
took
over
.

The
unexpectedly
wide
U.S.
August
trade
deficit
of
$
10.77
billion
hit
an
already
jittery
U.K.
market
in
midafternoon
.

Michael
Hicks
,
who
manages
sales
and
trading
for
brokerage
concern
Societe
Generale
Strauss
Turnbull
,
said
:
``
It

you

n't

and
if
you

,
you
wish
you
had
n't

''

He
said
the
current
market
``
is
all
about
sentiment
,
and
the
sentiment
in
London
is
90

anxiety
and
worry
.
''

Britain
's
economic
fundamentals
,
he
said
,
``
do
n't
look
very
bright
.
''

Dealers
said
London
showed
signs
of
calming
in
midafternoon
after
Wall
Street
avoided
sharp
losses
despite
the
trade
report
,
but
a
wave
of
futures-related
selling
later
in
the
session
sent
buyers
back
to
the
sidelines
.

Still
,
some
sectors
found
buying
interest
after
being
actively
sold
in
recent
weeks
.

Merchant
banks
were
stronger
across
the
board
.

Morgan
Grenfell
,
which
has
been
mentioned
in
takeover
rumors
,
rose
20
to
392

(
$
6.18

a

.

S.G.
Warburg
,
a
rumored
target
of
some
European
banking

,
finished
22
higher
at

.

Hambros
rose
5
to

and
Schroders
rose
25
to

On
the
corporate
front
,
Ford
Motor
announced
that
it
raised
its
stake
in
U.K.
luxury
car
maker
Jaguar
to
10.4

.

Jaguar
shares
jumped
23

easing
to
close
at

up

Amstrad
,
a
British
computer
hardware

,
eased

It
announced
a
52

Brewery
stocks
were
firm

,
but
most
ended
below

but
Whitbread

shares
rose
17

363
.

Dealers
said
there
was
late
talk
of
a
Whitbread
sale
of
brewing
operations
to
Scottish

Newcastle
.

The
most
active
shares
were
major
blue-chips
,
particularly
oils
and
utilities
such
as
British
Gas
and
British
Telecommunications
.

Traders
attributed
the
action
in
them
largely
to
defensive
positioning
in
a
volatile
market
.

British
Gas
finished
at
197
,
down

,
on
13
million
shares
,
British
Petroleum
fell
8
to

and
British

lower
at
261
on
turnover
of

.

Cable

Wireless
fell
20
to

.

Also
in
active
trading
,
British
Steel
fell
1
to
124
as
20
million
shares
changed
hands
.

Racal
Electric
,
which
traded
11
million

,
declined
12
to
218

In
other
European
markets
,
share
prices
closed
sharply
higher
in
Frankfurt
and
Zurich
and
posted
moderate
rises
in
Stockholm
,
Amsterdam
and
Milan
.

Paris
closed
lower
,
and
most
Brussels
shares
were
unable
to
trade
for
a
second
consecutive
day
because
of
technical
problems
.

South
African
gold

Elsewhere
,
share
prices
rebounded
in
Hong

,
Sydney
,
Singapore
,
Wellington
,
Taipei
,
Manila
and
Seoul
.

In
Hong
Kong
,
Sydney
and
Singapore
--
the
largest
of
those
exchanges
--
stocks
recovered
one-third
to
one-half
of
the
ground
they
lost
in
Monday
's
plunge
,
with
major
market
indexes
posting
gains
of
3.6
%
to

price
trends
on
the

To
make
them
directly
comparable
,
each

is
based
on
the
close

The
percentage

is
since
year-end

Inc.
said
it
received
approval
to

said
they
completed
the

AVX
,

,
paid
$
11

.

Passive

Consolidated
Papers
Inc.
said
it
plans
to
spend
$
495
million
on
new
paper-manufacturing
equipment
and
facilities
.

The
producer
of
paper
used
in
magazines
and
by
commercial
printers
said
spending
on
the
expansion
is
planned
to
begin
in
the
first
quarter
of
1990
.

The
expansion
is
subject
to
approval
by
federal
and
Wisconsin
environmental
regulators
.

THE
STOCK
of
Applied
Power
Inc.
,
which
split
2-for-1
in
May
,
has
risen
since
August
1988
.

In
yesterday
's
edition
,
it
was
incorrectly
stated
that
the
company
's
share
price
has
softened
since
August
1988
.

The
stock
market
's
dizzying
gyrations
during
the
past
few
days
have
made
a
lot
of
individual
investors
wish
they
could
buy
some
sort
of
insurance
.

After
all
,
they
wo
n't
soon
forget
the
stock
bargains
that
became
available
after
the
October
1987
crash
.

But
while
they
want
to
be
on
the
alert
for
similar
buying
opportunities
now
,
they
're
afraid
of
being
hammered
by
another
terrifying
plunge
.

The
solution
,
at
least
for
some
investors
,
may
be
a
hedging
technique
that
's
well
known
to
players
in
the
stock-options
market
.

Called
a
``
married
put
,
''
the
technique
is
carried
out
by
purchasing
a
stock
and
simultaneously
buying
a
put
option
on
that
stock
.

It
's
like
``
fire
insurance
,
''
says
Harrison
Roth
,
the
senior
options
strategist
at
Cowen
&
Co
.

Because
a
put
option
gives
its
owner
the
right
,
but
not
the
obligation
,
to
sell
a
fixed
number
of
shares
of
the
stock
at
a
stated
price
on
or
before
the
option
's
expiration
date
,
the
investor
is
protected
against
a
sudden
drop
in
the
stock
's
price
.

But
most
investment
advisers
do
n't
recommend
using
married
puts
all
the
time
.

That
's
because
the
cost
of
buying
put
options
eats
into
an
investor
's
profit
when
stock
prices
rise
.

``
This
is
the
type
of
fire
insurance
you
only
buy
when
the
nearby
woods
are
on
fire
,
''
says
Mr.
Roth
.

``
You
always
want
your
house
insured
,
but
you
do
n't
always
feel
the
need
for
your
investments
to
be
insured
.
''

In
addition
to
hedging
new
stock
purchases
,
the
married-put
technique
can
be
used
to
protect
stocks
that
an
investor
already
owns
.

In
either
case
,
the
investor
faces
three
possible
outcomes
:

--
If
the
stock
goes
up
in
price
between
now
and
the
put
's
expiration
date
,
the
put
will
probably
expire
worthless
.

The
investor
will
be
out
the
cost
of
the
put
,
which
is
called
the
``
premium
,
''
and
this
loss
will
reduce
the
stock-market
profit
.

--
If
the
stock
stays
at
the
same
price
between
now
and
the
put
's
expiration
date
,
the
investor
's
loss
will
be
limited
to
the
cost
of
the
put
,
less
any
amount
realized
from
a
closing
sale
of
the
put
.

The
worst-case
scenario
would
be
if
the
put
expires
worthless
.

--
If
the
price
of
the
stock
declines
,
the
put
will
increase
in
value
.

Once
the
stock
price
is
less
than
the
exercise
price
,
or
``
strike
price
,
''
of
the
put
,
the
gain
will
match
the
loss
on
the
stock
dollar
for
dollar
.

The
put
establishes
a
minimum
selling
price
for
the
stock
during
its
life
.

When
a
stock
falls
below
the
put
's
strike
price
,
the
investor
simply
sells
the
stock
at
a
loss
and
simultaneously
sells
the
put
at
a
profit
.

Or
,
the
investor
can
exercise
the
put
,
by
tendering
the
stock
to
his
or
her
broker
in
return
for
payment
from
another
investor
who
has
sold
a
put
on
the
same
stock
.

Brokers
handle
such
transactions
through
the
Options
Clearing
Corp.
,
which
guarantees
all
option
trades
.

The
accompanying
table
shows
how
this
strategy
would
work
for
three
stocks
.

Though
not
reflected
in
the
table
,
an
investor
should
know
that
the
cost
of
the
option
insurance
can
be
partially
offset
by
any
dividends
that
the
stock
pays
.

For
example
,
Tenneco
Inc.
pays
a
quarterly
dividend
of
76
cents
,
which
would
be
received
before
the
February
option
expires
and
,
thus
,
reduce
the
cost
of
using
the
technique
by
that
amount
.

In
this
case
,
the
investor
's
risk
would
n't
exceed
3.6
%
of
the
total
investment
.

To
simplify
the
calculations
,
commissions
on
the
option
and
underlying
stock
are
n't
included
in
the
table
.

There
are
more
than
650
stocks
on
which
options
may
be
bought
and
sold
,
including
some
over-the-counter
stocks
.

But
some
investors
might
prefer
a
simpler
strategy
then
hedging
their
individual
holdings
.

They
can
do
this
by
purchasing
``
index
puts
,
''
which
are
simply
put
options
on
indexes
that
match
broad
baskets
of
stocks
.

For
instance
,
the
most
popular
index
option
is
the
S&P
100
option
,
commonly
called
the
OEX
.

It
is
based
on
the
stocks
that
make
up
Standard
&
Poor
's
100-stock
index
.

Unlike
options
on
individual
issues
,
index
options
are
settled
only
in
cash
,
and
no
stock
is
ever
tendered
.

But
while
index
options
are
convenient
,
they
have
several
disadvantages
.

For
one
thing
,
an
investor
's
portfolio
might
not
closely
match
the
S&P
100
.

As
a
result
,
the
OEX
insurance
may
or
may
not
fully
protect
an
investor
's
holdings
in
the
event
of
a
market
decline
.

In
addition
,
OEX
options
were
suspended
from
trading
last
Friday
afternoon
,
after
the
stock-market
sell-off
got
under
way
and
trading
in
the
S&P-500
futures
contract
was
halted
.

So
an
investor
who
wanted
to
realize
a
profit
on
OEX
puts
after
the
trading
suspension
would
have
been
out
of
luck
.

On
the
other
hand
,
only
a
handful
of
individual
issues
were
suspended
from
trading
on
Friday
.

Normally
,
once
the
underlying
investment
is
suspended
from
trading
,
the
options
on
those
investments
also
do
n't
trade
.

Ultimately
,
whether
the
insurance
provided
by
purchasing
puts
is
worthwhile
depends
on
the
cost
of
the
options
.

That
cost
rises
in
times
of
high
market
volatility
.

But
it
still
might
be
cheaper
than
taking
a
major
hit
.

The
protection
from
using
married
puts
is
clearly
superior
to
that
afforded
by
another
options
strategy
some
investors
consider
using
during
troubled
times
:
selling
call
options
on
stocks
the
investor
owns
.

A
call
option
is
similar
to
a
put
,
except
that
it
gives
its
owner
the
right
to
buy
shares
at
a
stated
price
until
expiration
.

Selling
a
call
option
gives
an
investor
a
small
buffer
against
a
stock-market
decline
.

That
's
because
it
reduces
the
cost
of
the
stock
by
the
amount
of
premium
received
from
the
sale
of
the
call
.

But
if
the
price
of
the
stock
rises
above
the
strike
price
of
the
option
,
the
stock
is
almost
certain
to
be
called
away
.

And
in
that
case
,
the
investor
misses
out
on
any
major
upside
gain
.

These
calculations
exclude
the
effect
of
commissions
paid
and
dividends
received
from
the
stock
.

All
prices
are
as
of
Monday
's
close
.

Hopes
for
quick
enactment
of
pending
deficit-reduction
legislation
faded
as
efforts
to
streamline
the
House
version
in
advance
of
a
House-Senate
conference
broke
down
.

House
leaders
had
hoped
to
follow
the
Senate
's
lead
by
getting
an
agreement
from
House
committee
chairmen
under
which
they
would
drop
items
that
would
n't
reduce
the
fiscal
1990
budget
deficit
from
the
House-passed
bill
before
the
negotiations
with
the
Senate
began
.

But
the
effort
became
snagged
on
the
question
of
what
would
become
of
other
issues
,
ranging
from
cutting
the
capital-gains
tax
to
child
care
to
repeal
of
catastrophic-illness
insurance
.

``
Many
members
feel
there
are
important
features
of
the
House
bill
that
should
be
enacted
,
''
Speaker
Thomas
Foley
(
D.
,
Wash
.
)
said
.

``
If
there
is
any
support
for
reducing
the
bill
,
it
is
conditioned
on
their
desire
to
see
them
passed
in

Now
those

will
be

could
begin
as
soon
as
today
,
with
the
expectation
that
they
could
either
be
resolved
there
or
placed
into

``
You

White
House
Budget
Director
Richard
Darman
has
said
he
would
continue
to
press
to
keep
the
capital-gains
provision
in
the
final
version
of
the
bill
unless
the
House
drops
many
of
its
costly
provisions
.

Senate
leaders
had
hoped
to
be
able
to
send
a
compromise
version
of
the
measure
to
President
Bush
by
the
end
of
the
week
,
but
Speaker
Foley
said
that
was
n't
likely
.

Failure
to
pass
the
bill
meant
that
$
16.1
billion
in
across-the-board
spending
cuts
took
effect
Monday
under
the
Gramm-Rudman
budget
law
.

The
bill
must
be
enacted
before
the
cuts
can
be
restored
.

Northgate

Steven

Walker
,
senior

a
director
of
both
Commercial
National

Cincinnati
Microwave
Inc.
said
it
introduced
two
radar
detectors
.

One
unit
,
called
the
Escort
,
uses
a
new
digital
signal-processing
technology
to
detect
radar
signals
much
sooner
than
was
previously
possible
,
the
company
said
.

The
other
,
called
the
Solo
,
is
battery
operated
and
is
the
first
high-performance
radar
detector
that
does
n't
need
a
power
cord
,
the
company
said
.

A
surprising
surge
in
the
U.S.
trade
deficit
raised
fears
that
the
nation
's
export
drive
has
stalled
,
and
caused
new
turmoil
in
financial
markets
.

The
merchandise
trade
deficit
widened
in
August
to
$
10.77
billion
,
the
Commerce
Department
reported
,
a
sharp
deterioration
from
July
's
$
8.24
billion
and
the
largest
deficit
of
any
month
this
year
.

Exports
fell
for
the
second
month
in
a
row
,
while
imports
rose
to
a
record
.

``
This
is
one
of
the
worst
trade
releases
we
've
had
since
the
dollar
troughed
out
in
1987
,
''
said
Geoffrey
Dennis
,
chief
international
economist
at
James
Capel
Inc
.

Like
most
analysts
,
Mr.
Dennis
was
hesitant
to
read
too
much
into
one
month
's
numbers
;
but
he
said
,
``
It
indicates
perhaps
that
the
balance
in
the
U.S.
economy
is
not
as
good
as
we
've
been
led
to
believe
.
''

The
number
had
a
troubling
effect
on
Wall
Street
,
suggesting
that
more
fundamental
economic
problems
may
underlie
last
Friday
's
stock
market
slide
.

The
Dow
Jones
Industrial
Average
tumbled
more
than
60
points
after
the
report
's
release
,
before
recovering
to
close
18.65
points
lower
at
2638.73
.

``
This
bad
trade
number
raises
some
deeper
issues
about
the
market
decline
,
''
said
Norman
Robertson
,
chief
economist
for
Mellon
Bank
.

``
It
raises
questions
about
more
deep-seated
problems
,
the
budget
deficit
and
the
trade
deficit
and
the
seeming
lack
of
ability
to
come
to
grips
with
them
.
''

The
trade
report
drew
yet
another
unsettling
parallel
to
October
1987
.

On
Oct.
14
of
that
year
,
the
announcement
of
an
unusually
large
August
trade
deficit
helped
trigger
a
steep
market
decline
.

The
slide
continued
until
the
record
508-point
market
drop
on
Oct.
19
.

In
1987
,
however
,
the
news
was
the
latest
in
a
string
of
disappointments
on
trade
,
while
the
current
report
comes
after
a
period
of
improvement
.

The
bleak
trade
report
was
played
down
by
the
Bush
administration
.

Commerce
Secretary
Robert
Mosbacher
called
the
worsening
trade
figures
``
disappointing
after
two
very
good
months
.
''

And
White
House
spokesman
Marlin
Fitzwater
said
the
deficit
was
``
an
unwelcome
increase
,
''
adding
that
``
we
're
hopeful
that
it
simply
is
a
one-month
situation
and
will
turn
around
.
''

But
the
figures
reinforced
the
view
of
many
private
analysts
that
the
improvement
in
the
U.S.
trade
deficit
has
run
out
of
steam
.

``
The
figures
today
add
further
evidence
to
support
the
view
that
the
improvement
in
the
U.S.
trade
deficit
has
essentially
stalled
out
at
a
level
of
about
a
$
110
billion
annual
rate
,
''
said
Jeffrey
Scott
,
a
research
fellow
at
the
Institute
for
International
Economics
here
.

``
That
's
still
an
improvement
over
last
year
,
but
it
leads
one
to
conclude
that
basically
we
've
gotten
all
the
mileage
we
can
out
of
past
dollar
depreciation
and
past
marginal
cuts
in
the
federal
budget
deficit
.
''

Exports
declined
for
the
second
consecutive
month
in
August
,
slipping
0.2
%
to
$
30.41
billion
,
the
Commerce
Department
reported
.

Imports
,
on
the
other
hand
,
leaped
6.4
%
to
a
record
$
41.18
billion
.

Not
only
was
August
's
deficit
far
worse
than
July
's
,
but
the
government
revised
the
July
figure
substantially
from
the
$
7.58
billion
deficit
it
had
initially
reported
last
month
.

Many
economists
contend
that
deep
cuts
in
the
U.S.
budget
deficit
are
needed
before
further
trade
improvement
can
occur
.

That
's
because
the
budget
deficit
feeds
an
enormous
appetite
in
this
country
for
both
foreign
goods
and
foreign
capital
,
overwhelming
the
nation
's
capacity
to
export
.

``
People
are
sick
and
tired
of
hearing
about
these
deficits
,
but
the
imbalances
are
still
there
and
they
are
still
a
problem
,
''
said
Mr.
Robertson
.

In
addition
,
the
rise
in
the
value
of
the
dollar
against
foreign
currencies
over
the
past
several
months
has
increased
the
price
of
U.S.
products
in
overseas
markets
and
hurt
the
country
's
competitiveness
.

Since
March
,
exports
have
been
virtually
flat
.

At
the
same
time
,
William
T.
Archey
,
international
vice
president
at
the
U.S.
Chamber
of
Commerce
,
notes
:
``
Clearly
the
stronger
dollar
has
made
imports
more
attractive
''
by
causing
their
prices
to
decline
.

Most
economists
expect
the
slowing
U.S.
economy
to
curb
demand
for
imports
.

But
they
foresee
little
substantial
progress
in
exports
unless
the
dollar
and
the
federal
budget
deficit
come
down
.

``
The
best
result
we
could
get
from
these
numbers
would
be
to
see
the
administration
and
Congress
get
serious
about
putting
the
U.S.
on
an
internationally
competitive
economic
footing
,
''
said
Howard
Lewis
,
vice
president
of
international
economic
affairs
at
the
National
Association
of
Manufacturers
.

``
That
must
start
with
cutting
the
federal
budget
deficit
.
''

August
's
decline
in
exports
reflected
decreases
in
sales
of
industrial
supplies
,
capital
goods
and
food
abroad
and
increases
in
sales
of
motor
vehicles
,
parts
and
engines
.

The
jump
in
imports
stemmed
from
across-the-board
increases
in
purchases
of
foreign
goods
.

The
numbers
were
adjusted
for
usual
seasonal
fluctuations
.

Steve
Jobs
took
a
step
back
from
the
frontier
of
personal-computer
technology
in
an
effort
to
spur
sales
of
Next
Inc.
's
new
machine
.

Mr.
Jobs
moved
to
remedy
a
couple
of
his
computer
's
drawbacks
yesterday
by
lowering
the
entry-level
price
for
a
Next
machine
by
$
1,500
,
or
23
%
,
if
the
buyer
chooses
a
hard-disk
drive
as
an
alternative
to
Next
's
optical-storage
device
.

The
hard
drive
,
which
is
the
storage
device
of
choice
for
virtually
every
desktop
computer
user
,
also
now
will
supplement
Next
's
futuristic
optical
device
if
buyers
pay
full
price
.

Mr.
Jobs
,
co-founder
of
Apple
Computer
Inc.
,
founded
Next
four
years
ago
in
the
hopes
of
fomenting
a
revolution
in
the
way
desktop
computers
are
designed
and
used
.

His
Next
computer
,
introduced
about
a
year
ago
and
aimed
primarily
at
university
computer
users
,
sports
snazzy
graphics
,
digital
sound
,
built-in
networking
and
a
sleek
black
design
.

But
the
computer
was
proving
a
hard
sell
because
of
its
high
price
,
a
lack
of
software
and
an
optical
data-storage
device
that
was
too
slow
.

The
machine
began
shipping
at
the
end
of
last
year
.

The
closely
held
company
has
n't
disclosed
sales
.

However
,
most
universities
that
have
bought
the
machines
say
they
are
buying
small
numbers
for
evaluation
purposes
.

Universities
can
now
buy
a
Next
computer
without
an
optical
storage
device
for
$
4,995
.

A
computer
with
the
optical
device
will
still
cost
$
6,495
,
but
from
now
on
Next
will
outfit
every
computer
with
a
hard
drive
and
supply
one
at
no
cost
to
those
who
have
already
bought
Next
machines
.

Commercial
customers
can
purchase
the
same
system
through
Businessland
Inc.
,
a
computer
retailer
based
in
San
Jose
,
Calif.
,
for
roughly
$
3,000
more
.

Mr.
Jobs
said
the
changes
were
prompted
by
requests
from
customers
who
are
frustrated
with
the
performance
of
the
optical
device
,
which
is
n't
offered
as
standard
equipment
by
any
rivals
.

Another
factor
was
that
customers
were
asking
,
``
Why
do
n't
you
give
us
a
cheaper
system
?
''
Mr.
Jobs
said
at
a
conference
on
university
computing
here
.

Optical-storage
devices
can
handle
very
large
amounts
of
data
and
make
it
far
easier
to
edit
film
clips
or
audio
recordings
with
a
computer
.

But
the
technology
,
while
reliable
,
is
far
slower
than
the
widely
used
hard
drives
.

To
get
around
the
delays
caused
by
the
optical
device
,
Businessland
,
which
is
Next
's
exclusive
dealer
to
corporations
,
has
for
months
been
advising
customers
to
purchase
hard
drives
with
the
machines
.

Next
's
decision
to
rely
on
the
more-established
hard
drive
in
every
Next
computer
does
n't
signal
a
retreat
from
optical
storage
,
said
Mr.
Jobs
,
who
for
years
has
said
this
technology
will
play
a
crucial
role
in
the
next
decade
.

``
We
're
extremely
committed
to
optical
storage
technology
''
he
said
.

``
We
think
everything
will
go
this
way
in
a
few
years
.
''

He
said
that
the
next
generation
of
optical
drives
will
be
as
fast
as
hard
drives
,
but
he
depends
on
outside
suppliers
for
the
devices
.

But
university
computer
specialists
,
who
welcomed
the
move
,
called
it
a
necessary
retreat
from
the
cutting
edge
of
technology
and
one
that
's
likely
to
increase
Next
's
sales
on
campuses
.

``
From
the
standpoint
of
being
on
the
forefront
of
technology
,
this
is
a
step
backward
,
''
said
Jerry
W.
Sprecher
,
a
senior
computing
manager
for
the
California
state
university
system
.

``
But
it
will
definitely
boost
Next
's
sales
.
''

Universities
,
however
,
say
Next
's
prices
must
go
even
lower
before
large
numbers
of
students
purchase
the
machine
.

``
We
'd
still
like
to
see
a
student
model
,
''
priced
at
about
$
3,500
,
said
Ronald
Johnson
,
director
of
academic
computing
at
Minnesota
's
Gustavus
Adolphus
College
,
which
has
bought
eight
Next
machines
.

Broad
acceptance
of
Next
's
computer
also
is
hindered
by
difficulty
in
distributing
software
for
it
.

Most
software
is
distributed
on
cheap
floppy
disks
,
but
the
Next
computer
does
n't
come
with
a
device
that
reads
them
.

Next
's
computer
also
needs
more
software
applications
,
but
Mr.
Jobs
said
he
expects
more
soon
.

He
said
he
expects
Lotus
Development
Corp.
to
introduce
a
Next
version
of
its
popular
1-2-3
spreadsheet
program
in
1990
.

Educators
added
that
Next
needs
to
soon
offer
a
color
version
of
its
computer
.

Every
major
maker
offers
computers
with
color
displays
.

Next
wo
n't
comment
on
when
it
will
do
the
same
,
but
is
believed
to
have
a
color
model
under
development
.

Ashton-Tate
Corp.
reported
a
net
loss
of
$
19.4
million
,
or
74
cents
a
share
,
for
the
third
quarter
,
which
was
burdened
by
severance
costs
and
the
expense
of
upgrading
its
database
software
inventories
.

The
software
company
said
revenue
slid
28
%
to
$
53.9
million
.

This
contrasts
with
the
year-ago
quarter
,
when
the
company
had
net
income
of
$
11.7
million
,
or
45
cents
a
share
,
on
revenue
of
$
75.7
million
.

For
the
nine
months
,
Ashton-Tate
had
a
loss
of
$
27.6
million
,
or
$
1.05
a
share
.

In
the
year-ago
period
,
the
company
had
profit
of
$
34.3
million
,
or
$
1.32
a
share
.

Revenue
in
the
period
slid
almost
8
%
to
$
203.2
million
from
about
$
220
million
last
year
.

Edward
M.
Esber
,
chairman
,
president
and
chief
executive
officer
,
attributed
the
decline
to
reduced
domestic
revenue
because
of
$
4.9
million
spent
to
upgrade
existing
software
inventories
to
the
new
database
IV
Version
1.1
,
and
$
1.8
million
spent
on
the
recent
reduction
in
work
force
.

He
said
the
company
was
``
encouraged
by
feedback
''
it
received
from

The
red
ink
came
as
no
surprise
to
Wall
Street
,
but
analysts
said
they
saw
ominous
hints
of
a
further
delay
in
volume
shipments
of
Version
1.1
,
a
harbinger
of
continued
losses
in
the
fourth
quarter
.

``
The
loss
is
in
line
with
our
expectations
,
''
said
John
C.
Maxwell
III
,
an
analyst
with
Dillon
,
Read
&
Co.
in
New
York
.

He
added
gross
margins
and
operating
profit
``
eroded
quite
dramatically
''
from
the
prior
quarter
,
along
with
sales
of
existing
software
product
lines
like
Multimate
and
Framework
.

``
The
success
of
a
new
product
in
the
database
line
is
needed
.

And
while
the
company
has
n't
made
a
definite
statement
,
it
now
looks
like
that
's
not
going
to
be
anytime
soon
,
''
Mr.
Maxwell
said
.

The
company
said
in
a
statement
that
it
expects
to
ship
new
products
``
during
the
next
two
quarters
.
''

``
It
now
looks
like
database
IV
Version
1.1
is
n't
going
to
be
{
widely
}
available
until
the
first
quarter
of
1990
,
''
said
David
Bayer
,
an
analyst
with
Montgomery
Securities
in
San
Francisco
.

``
This
is
the
second
delay
now
in
getting
the
product
out
the
door
.

It
does
prolong
the
pain
somewhat
.
''

Mr.
Maxwell
said
unless
the
company
can
start
shipments
of
the
new
product
sometime
this
quarter
,
the
fourth-quarter
loss
is
likely
to
be
``
comparable
to
the
third
quarter
's
.
''

If
the
company
can
start
to
ship
during
this
quarter
,
it
could
stem
some
,
if
not
all
of
the
red
ink

The
public
sector
borrowing
requirement
,
the
most
widely
used
measure
of
Britain
's
government
deficit
or
surplus
,
showed
a
deficit
of
#
200
million
in
September
,
compared
with
a
deficit
of
#
765
million
in
August
and
a
deficit
of
#
1.08
billion
in
September
1988
,
the
Treasury
said
.

In
the
six
months
since
the
current
fiscal
year
began
April
1
,
the
surplus
totaled
#
500
million
,
compared
with
a
surplus
of
#
3.6
billion
in
the
year-earlier
period
.

The
government
is
projecting
a
#
14
billion
surplus
for
the
fiscal
year
.

The
reported
figures
for
the
public
sector
borrowing
requirement
include
receipts
from
the
sale
of
state-owned
industries
.

Excluding
those
receipts
,
the
government
deficit
would
have
totaled
about
#
2.5
billion
in
the
first
six
months
,
compared
with
#
1.3
billion
a
year
earlier
,
the
Treasury

unchanged
from

earlier
,
according
to
the
National
Steel
Manufacturers
'
Association
.

The
association
said
the
September
total
brought
French
output
for
the
first
nine
months
this
year
to
14,789,000
tons
,
up

from

Prospect
Group
Inc.
,
whose
recent
hostile
tender
offer
for
Recognition
Equipment
Inc.
failed
for
lack
of
financing
,
apparently
has
gained
a
measure
of
control
over
the
troubled
company
anyway
.

As
part
of
what
a
Recognition
spokeswoman
termed
an
``
amiable
agreement
,
''
Prospect
Group
will
wind
up
with
control
of
top
management
posts
and
an
increased
stake
in
the
maker
of
data
management
equipment
.

In
a
management
restructuring
,
Thomas
L.
Ringer
resigned
as
chairman
,
chief
executive
and
a
director
,
while
Israel
Sheinberg
resigned
as
a
director
.

Mr.
Sheinberg
remains
as
executive
vice
president
.

Thomas
M.
Hurley
and
Robert
A.
Vanourek
,
who
had
been
designated
to
take
over
Recognition
's
top
spots
had
Prospect
's
tender
offer
succeeded
,
were
named
co-chief
executives
and
directors
.

Mr.
Hurley
was
formerly
a
vice
president
and
general
manager
of
an
Avery
International
division
;
Mr.
Vanourek
was
a
former
group
vice
president
of
Pitney
Bowes
Inc
.

In
addition
,
the
agreement
calls
for
Gilbert
H.
Lamphere
,
chairman
of
Prospect
Group
's
executive
committee
,
to
be
named
chairman
of
a
restructured
board
that
will
include
four
new
independent
directors
.

Also
named
to
the
revised
board
was
Thomas
A.
Loose
,
Recognition
's
senior
vice
president
and
general
counsel
.

Prospect
,
a
New
York-based
leveraged
buy-out
firm
,
also
agreed
to
invest
$
15
million
in
Recognition
,
which
in
turn
agreed
to
repurchase
as
much
as
$
20
million
of
its
stock
.

That
would
increase
Prospect
's
ownership
of
the
company
's
fully-diluted
shares
outstanding
to
20
%
from
14.1
%
.

Under
the
agreement
,
Prospect
is
permitted
to
increase
its
stake
in
Recognition
to
30
%
.

Beyond
that
,
Prospect
said
it
would
n't
offer
to
acquire
additional
shares
for
less
than
$
11.25
a
share
during
the
next
year
or
less
than
$
14.06
a
share
during
the
subsequent
two
years
.

Recognition
also
said
it
obtained
a
commitment
from
Chemical
Bank
and
Bank
of
Boston
to
convert
an
estimated
$
18
million
in
bank
debt
to
a
new
,
24-month
secured
term
loan
to
be
repaid
through
the
sale
of
certain
assets
.

In
August
,
Recognition
said
it
was
in
violation
of
certain
terms
of
its
debt
agreements
with
bank
lenders
because
of
a
$
3.9
million
loss
for
the
third
quarter
ended
July
31
.

The
company
attributed
the
loss
to
declining
revenue
and
litigation
costs
relating
to
criminal
charges
against
the
company
and
two
former
executives
,
William
G.
Moore
Jr.
and
Robert
W.
Reedy
.

The
former
executives
were
indicted
last
October
on
charges
of
fraud
,
theft
and
conspiracy
related
to
efforts
by
the
company
to
win
$
400
million
in
Postal
Service
contracts
.

Recognition
Equipment
said
it
expected
to
put
the
agreement
with
Prospect
to
a
vote
of
its
stockholders
at
a
special
meeting
in
January
.

In
New
York
Stock
Exchange
composite
trading
,
Recognition
rose
87.5
cents
to
$
6.625
.

Prospect
slipped
25
cents
to
$
10.50
in
national
over-the-counter
trading
.

General
Motors
Corp.
's
Chevrolet
division
,
reacting
to
slow
sales
,
said
it
will
offer
$
800
rebates
on
its
1990
Beretta
,
the
two-door
version
of
its
core
compact-car
line
.

Sluggish
sales
of
the
Beretta
,
and
its
four-door
sister
car
,
the
Corsica
,
prompted
GM
to
idle
the
two
plants
that
build
the
automobiles
for
a
total
of
three
weeks
this
month
.

The
Corsica
and
Beretta
make
up
the
highest-volume
car
line
at
Chevrolet
,
but
sales
of
the
vehicles
are
off
9.6
%
for
the
year
,
and
fell
a
steep
34
%
during
early
October
.

Chevrolet
already
is
offering
an
$
800
rebate
on
the
1990-model
Corsica
.

The
latest
rebate
is
good
for
all
Beretta
models
.

Chevrolet
buyers
can
take
the

said
it
submitted
an
offer
to
the
directors
of
Mesa
Airlines
to
acquire
the
Farmington

carrier
.

Except
to
characterize
its
offer
as
``
fair
and
generous
and
in
the
best
interests
of
Mesa
shareholders
,
''
StatesWest
declined
to
discuss
details
of
its
proposal
.

It
also
asked
Mesa
to
keep
the
proposal
confidential
.

A
Mesa
official
confirmed
receipt
of
the
offer
and
said
directors
would
meet
to
consider
it
.

Last
week
,
Mesa
rejected
a
proposal
by
StatesWest
to
acquire
it
or
merge
.

StatesWest
has
a
7.25

stake
in

,
which
operates

twin-engine
and
two
single-engine
turboprops
among

,

,

.

StatesWest
operates

The
former
president
of
FirstSouth
F.A.
,
a
defunct
Arkansas
thrift
,
pleaded
guilty
to
conspiring
to
inflate
the
institution
's
earnings
by
concealing
worthless
loan
guarantees
.

Roderick
D.
Reed
III
,
who
was
also
chief
operating
officer
of
FirstSouth
,
could
receive
a
maximum
sentence
of
five
years
in
federal
prison
and
a
$
250,000
fine
.

A
sentencing
date
has
n't
been
set
.

Mr.
Reed
admitted
he
conspired
to
conceal
an
agreement
not
to
enforce
loan
guarantees
executed
by
Dallas
real-estate
developers
A.
Starke
Taylor
III
and
George
S.
Watson
,
both
of
whom
were
FirstSouth
stockholders
.

Neither
Mr.
Taylor
nor
Mr.
Watson
have
been
charged
with
criminal
wrongdoing
.

By
concealing
the
non-enforcement
agreement
,
certain
transactions
with
Messrs.
Taylor
and
Watson
were
entered
on
FirstSouth
's
books
as
loans
,
allowing
the
thrift
to
report
fees
and
interest
as
current
income
,
according
to
the
U.S.
attorney
's
office
in
Little
Rock
,
Ark
.

The
conspiracy
was
part
of
an
effort
by
Mr.
Reed
to
hide
FirstSouth
's
shaky
financial
condition
from
federal
regulators
,
according
to
federal
prosecutors
and
regulators
.

The
$
1.68
billion
thrift
was
declared
insolvent
and
closed
in
December
1986
.

FirstSouth
's
former
chairman
and
chief
executive
officer
,
Howard
Weichern
,
is
also
charged
with
conspiring
to
conceal
the
agreements
with
Messrs.
Watson
and
Taylor
.

Mr.
Weichern
is
scheduled
for
trial
Jan.
3
before
federal
Judge
Stephen
Reasoner
of
Little
Rock
.

I
approached
``
Mastergate
,
''
Larry
Gelbart
's
new
comedy
at
the
Criterion
Center
,
with
considerable
trepidation
.

Nothing
,
I
assumed
,
would
be
more
hopelessly
dated
than
a
political
satire
on
the
Iran-Contra
affair
.

I
had
underestimated
,
however
,
both
Mr.
Gelbart
's
wit
and
the
persistence
of
scandal
in
Washington
.

Though
the
play
clearly
is
framed
around
the
events
of
Iran-Contra
,
it
takes
in
the
wide
sweep
of
scandals
over
the
past
30
years
.

In
fact
,
at
one
point
Merry
Chase
(
Melinda
Mullins
)
,
a
cool
,
carefully
coiffed
television
announcer
,
recites
a
list
of
a
dozen
or
more
scandals
of
recent
years
,
concluding
with
those
affecting
the
Department
of
Housing
and
Urban
Development
and
the
savings
and
loan
industry
.

Onstage
,
a
congressional
hearing
is
in
progress
,
complete
with
elegant
crystal
chandelier
overhead
and
a
lifesize
reproduction
of
the
signing
of
the
Constitution
in
the
background
.

The
witness
table
is
center
stage
and
below
it
,
the
paraphernalia
for
the
ever-present
media
,
in
this
case
TNN
,
the
Total
News
Network
.

Not
only
are
there
camera
operators
on
all
sides
,
but
the
proceedings
are
shown
on
monitors
throughout
the
theater
.

The
metaphor
of
theater
is
not
entirely
coincidental
.

Mr.
Gelbart
clearly
feels
that
all
the
participants
in
a
congressional
hearing
--
the
witnesses
,
the
lawyers
,
the
interrogators
and
the
news
media
--
are
performers
.

As
the
story
of
``
Mastergate
''
unfolds
,
we
learn
that
the
Internal
Revenue
Service
confiscated
one
of
the
properties
of
a
foreign
financier
who
owes
the
government
millions
in
taxes
.

The
man
,
it
seems
,
has
a
Lichtenstein
corporation
,
licensed
in
Libya
and
sheltered
in
the
Bahamas
.

He
himself
lives
in
a
``
consecutive
series
of
unnumbered
houses
in
a
town
in
Switzerland
.
''

The
property
seized
by
the
IRS
is
a
Hollywood
film
studio
,
Master
Pictures
Incorporated
(
MPI
)
.

Supposedly
the
IRS
will
sell
off
the
assets
of
MPI
,
but
before
it
can
,
a
lowly
IRS
agent
is
called
into
the
hospital
room
of
Wylie
Slaughter
,
the
dying
head
of
the
Central
Intelligence
Agency
.

The
lowly
agent
,
Abel
Lamb
,
who
as
you
might
guess
,
is
being
led
to
the
slaughter
,
is
ordered
to
take
over
the
studio
.

Soon
the
studio
is
producing
a
$
40
million
picture
called
``
Tet
,
the
Motion
Picture
,
''
to
distinguish
it
from
``
Tet
,
the
Offensive
,
''
as
well
as
``
Tet
,
the
Book
''
and
``
Tet
,
the
Album
.
''

The
picture
,
to
be
made
in
the
Central
American
country
of
San
Elvador
,
is
a
cover
for
sending
$
800
million
of
arms
to
Los
Otros
,
the
rebel
group
attempting
to
regain
neighboring
Ambigua
,
which
has
been
taken
over
by
the
leftist
dictator
Dr.
Overtega
,
a
former
podiatrist
,
who
leads
a
revolutionary
band
of
foot
soldiers
.

The
man
handling
all
this
for
the
now-deceased
Slaughter
is
Major
Manley
Battle
,
Mr.
Gelbart
's
stand
in
for
Col.
Oliver
North
.

Director
Michael
Engler
has
assembled
a
top-flight
cast
to
carry
out
the
impersonations
of
well-known
political
figures
and
to
play
the
stock
characters
who
invariably
show
up
at
congressional
hearings
.

Daniel
von
Bargen
is
ramrod-stiff
but
totally
assured
as
Major
Battle
,
mixing
just
the
right
brand
of
self-righteousness
and
patriotism
;
Jeff
Weiss
is
fire
,
brimstone
and
teary-eyed
emotionalism
as
the
far-right
senator
who
serves
as
a
friendly
interrogator
of
Major
Battle
;
Zach
Grenier
is
maddeningly
officious
playing
a
succession
of
lawyers
;
Joseph
Daly
has
the
perfect
``
aw
,
shucks
''
demeanor
of
George
Bush
in
his
portrayal
of
the
vice
president
;
and
Ann
McDonough
is
first-rate
as
a
succession
of
witnesses
'
wives
.

With
one
she
is
pregnant
,
with
Major
Battle
she
is
knitting
an
American
flag
,
and
as
the
vice
president
's
wife
she
rushes
in
with
white
hair
,
wearing
a
tailored
suit
and
pearls
,
imitating
Barbara
Bush
's
gestures
down
to
the
last
detail
.

Though
it
's
clear
that
Mr.
Gelbart
's
sympathies
do
not
lie
with
the
far
right
,
it
's
also
true
that
he
is
evenhanded
in
dispensing
his
satirical
jabs
,
taking
sharp
aim
at
senators
and
congressmen
of
all
stripes
and
particularly
at
the
media
.

Mr.
Gelbart
also
has
fun
with
language
.

``
Mastergate
''
is
subtitled
``
a
play
on
words
,
''
and
Mr.
Gelbart
plays
that
game
as
well
as
anyone
.

He
describes
a
Mastergate
flunky
as
one
who
experienced
a
``
meteoric
disappearance
''
and
found
himself
``
handling
blanket
appeals
at
the
Bureau
of
Indian
Affairs
.
''

This
interest
in
words
goes
beyond
puns
and
playfulness
,
however
.

Mr.
Gelbart
deplores
the
obfuscation
,
the
circumlocution
and
the
debasement
of
language
he
sees
on
all
sides
.

As
the
hearings
begin
,
the
self-important
Sen.
Bowman
(
Jerome
Kilty
)
announces
:
``
Let
me
emphaticize
one
thing
at
the
outset
:
We
are
not
looking
for
hides
to
skin
nor
goats
to
scape
.
''

Major
Battle
himself
speaks
in
pure
Pentagonese
:
``
Without
further
monetary-stroke-military
aid
,
scores
of
Ambiguan
freedom
lovers
,
who
had
gone
way
out
on
their
life
and
limbs
for
us
,
were
literally
cut
off
at
the
knees
without
a
paddle
.
''

At
another
point
he
intones
:
``
Publicity
is
a
small
price
to
pay
for
secrecy
.
''

The
evening
is
short
--
95
minutes
without
an
intermission
--
but
even
so
,
as
the
play
progresses
the
thrust
of
Mr.
Gelbart
's
satire
loses
its
sharpness
as
his
targets
pop
up
ever
more
predictably
.

Most
of
the
evening
,
though
,
is
filled
with
rare
and
welcome
wit
.

In
``
Mastergate
,
''
Mr.
Gelbart
has
provided
us
not
just
one
but
two
commodities
that
have
all
but
disappeared
from
the
Broadway
theater
:
sharp
political
satire
and
an
even
sharper
appreciation
of
the
value
of
language
.

The
Federal
National
Mortgage
Association
set
up
a
three-member
office
of
the
chairman
and
elected
James
A.
Johnson
as
vice
chairman
,
effective
Jan.
1
.

Mr.
Johnson
has
been
a
managing
director
at
Shearson
Lehman
Hutton
since
1985
,
and
before
that
was
president
of
Public
Strategies
,
a
Washington
consulting
firm
.

He
is
well-known
in
Democratic
circles
,
having
been
executive
assistant
to
Vice
President
Walter
Mondale
and
chairman
of
Mr.
Mondale
's
1984
presidential
campaign
.

At

,
he
will
take
responsibility
for
the
corporation
's

legal
areas
and
will
work

,
and
Roger
Birk
,
president
and

Mr.

,
45
years
old
,
has
been
a
consultant
on
strategy
to
Fannie
Mae
for
the
past
3
1\/2
years
.

In
an
interview
,
he
said
Fannie
Mae
faces
a
number
of
challenges
with
the
restructuring
of
the
thrift
industry
and
the
push
to
broaden
its
activities
overseas
.

``
There
's
no
shortage
of
major
things
to
do
,
''
he
said
.

Fannie

also
said
James

,
chairman
of

and
a

since

,
moved
up
the

``
The
New
Crowd
''
by
Judith
Ramsey
Ehrlich
and
Barry
J.
Rehfeld
(
Little
,
Brown
,
444
pages
,
$
19.95
)
,
describes
the
displacing
of
the
old
``
our
crowd
''
Jewish
Wall
Street
banking
grandees
by
such
new
business
barons
as
Saul
Steinberg
,
Carl
Icahn
,
Sanford
Weill
and
Bruce
Wasserstein
.

Its
many
lively
stories
include
the
Gutfreund-Postel
holiday
cheer
imbroglio
.

These
two
New
Crowd
families
lived
in
the
same
apartment
building
,
with
the
Postel
penthouse
perched
on
top
of
the
Gutfreund
duplex
.

The
penthouse
elevator
started
up
from
the
Gutfreund
landing
,
and
Susan
Gutfreund
used
to
turn
off
its
light
,
to
give
the
impression
that
there
was
no
higher
floor
.

Eventually
,
Mr.
Postel
broke
his
toe
in
the
dark
.

Then
the
Gutfreunds
determined
to
put
up
a
22-foot
Christmas
tree
,
weighing
a
quarter
of
a
ton
,
to
amaze
their
holiday
guests
.

For
this
,
a
crane
needed
to
be
mounted
on
the
Postels
'
terrace
.

The
Postels
did
not
give
permission
.

But
the
Gutfreund
workers
went
ahead
anyway
,
only
to
be
captured
``
in
flagrante
''
by
Joan
Postel
,
who
called
the
police
.

Before
the
Gutfreunds
finally
left
this
unfriendly
environment
for
a
prodigious
duplex
on
Fifth
Avenue
and
an
18th-century
mansion
with
a
specially
excavated
$
1
million
garage
in
Paris
,
the
Postels
had
obtained
an
injunction
to
prevent
any
future
hoisting
of
trees
,
and
in
a
neighborly
spirit
hit
both
the
Gutfreunds
and
the
building
with
a
$
35
million
lawsuit
.

Nothing
less
,
it
seemed
,
could
console
them
for
their
traumas
.

Where
had
all
the
money
come
from
?

The
young
John
Gutfreund
had
been
discovered
by
Billy
Salomon
of
Salomon
Bros.
when
he
was
still
a
bearded
liberal
,
and
put
to
work
as
a
trader
,
and
then
as
a
rough-and-tumble
syndicator
.

``
`
Get
off
your
...
,
'
he
would
bellow
,
''
say
the
authors
.

Rising
in
the
firm
,
he
became
powerful
and
bland
,
though
his
new
wife
,
Susan
,
made
him
shine
in
the
gossip
columns
with
her
profligate
spending
habits
and
flamboyant
frocks
.

After
he
had
been
head
of
the
company
for
3
1\/2
years
,
he
and
his
partners
sold
it
to
Phibro
,
a
powerful
commodity
trading
outfit
,
for
$
550
million
in
Phibro
stock
.

Limited
partner
Billy
Salomon
,
whose
family
name
had
been
on
the
firm
's
door
for
70
years
and
who
had
hoped
it
would
be
there
forever
,
was
not
consulted
.

Mr.
Gutfreund
collected
$
32
million
,
while
Billy
Salomon
got
$
10
million
,
much
less
than
if
he
had
conducted
the
sale
.

``
I
felt
betrayed
,
''
he
later
said
.

Worse
,
Salomon
's
timing
had
been
off
.

Its
profits
,
unlike
Phibro
's
,
soared
over
the
next
two
years
,
and
had
it
held
out
,
Salomon
could
have
gotten
an
even
bigger
bundle
.

The
book
also
recounts
the
not
dissimilar
maneuvers
surrounding
the
changing
of
the
guard
at
Lehman
Bros.
and
other
grand
old
firms
.

Often
the
genteel
,
conservative
,
long-term-oriented
investment
bankers
were
displaced
by
crude
traders
:
``
When
angered
,
he
cursed
so
forcefully
that
his
face
reddened
and
his
pale-blue
eyes
narrowed
into
tiny
slits
,
''
the
authors
say
of
Lehman
's
Lewis
Glucksman
.

The
earlier
generation
of
``
our
crowd
''
bankers
--
Belmonts
,
Warburgs
,
Lehmans
,
Baches
and
Schiffs
--
had
stressed
above
all
probity
,
tradition
,
continuity
and
reputation
.

They
were
old-fashioned
elegant
gentlemen
,
who
happened
to
be
of
German
Jewish
extraction
.

But
in
the
harsh
world
of
today
's
Wall
Street
they
have
lost
out
to
more
aggressive
and
sometimes
less
scrupulous
successors
.

The
cuckoo
prefers
the
nests
of
other
birds
and
heaves
out
their
eggs
.

But
the
old
guard
hired
the
New
Crowd
people
:
It
brought
in
its
own
cuckoos
.

So
,
as
the
Old
Crowd
toppled
from
the
branch
,
it
should
n't
have
been
too
surprised
.

The
old
guard
had
every
right
,
however
,
to
disdain
the
newcomers
'
new
ways
of
making
money
,
such
as
greenmail
.

(
A
Fortune
article
on
Saul
Steinberg
was
entitled
,
``
Fear
and
Loathing
in
the
Corporate
Boardrooms
.
''
)

Their
other
staple
has
been
corporate
takeovers
,
often
hostile
and
financed
by
junk
bonds
.

Hostile
takeovers
are
quite
a
new
phenomenon
.

Sometimes
they
are
constructive
,
but
often
not
.

First
,
by
making
management
focus
on
short-term
results
,
they
inhibit
building
for
the
future
--
just
the
opposite
of
Japan
.

Second
,
a
long-term
shareholder
of
a
good
company
need
n't
worry
too
much
when
the
stock
price
drops
temporarily
:
It
will
bounce
back
.

But
if
a
raider
takes
over
when
the
stock
is
weak
,
the
shareholder
never
gets
his
recovery
.

The
raiders
,
meanwhile
,
have
evolved
their
own
pattern
for
spending
their
new
millions
.

As
described
in
``
The
New
Crowd
,
''
they
take
on
ambitious
new
wives
,
move
to
Greenwich
,
Conn.
,
or
Bedford
,
N.Y.
,
buy
OK
pictures
,
and
let
their
wives
share
the
wealth
with
decorators
.

Having
donated
heavily
to
museums
,
they
demand
a
place
on
their
boards
.

The
book
is
patronizing
about
this
nouveau
riche
struggle
for
respectability
,
which
has
its
tawdry
aspects
.

However
,
on
balance
,
the
charity
game
helps
America
.

If
those
who
have
the
money
do
n't
get
involved
with
the
museums
and
the
charities
,
then
City
Hall
will
do
it
,
badly
.

It
has
been
rightly
observed
that
the
main
thing
wrong
with
tainted
money
is
,
t'
ai
nt
enough
of
it
.

A
handful
of
the
New
Crowd
operators
have
crossed
the
line
from
the
immoral
to
the
illegal
,
and
have
ended
up
in
the
slammer
or
paying
huge
fines
:

Ivan
Boesky
,
Dennis
Levine
,
Martin
Siegel
,
Victor
and
Steven
Posner
,
and
now
Michael
Milken
and
perhaps
Leona
Helmsley
.

The
glitzy
office
that
Ivan
Boesky
vacated
for
a
prison
cell
had
previously
contained
commodity
operators
Marc
Rich
and
``
Pinky
''
Green
,
today
fugitives
from
a
potential
century
apiece
of
jail
sentences
.

The
Old
Crowd
is
deeply
concerned
by
the
backlash
from
all
this
.

However
,
the
phenomenon
is
not
specifically
Jewish
.

It
has
always
been
true
that
those
outside
the
club
want
to
climb
in
,
and
that
a
few
will
cut
corners
in
the
process
.

Some
pretty
seamy
stuff
built
the
turn-of-the-century
families
'
Fifth
Avenue
and
Newport
palazzi
and
endowed
their
daughters
'
weddings
to
foreign
noblemen
.

Mr.
Boesky
was
a
piker
compared
to
Jay
Gould
and
Jim
Fiske
,
and
Commodore
Vanderbilt
thought
nothing
of
bribing
judges
and
legislators
.

So
who
knows
?

In
a
generation
or
two
some
of
the
New
Crowd
may
attain
true
respectability
,
perhaps
to
be
displaced
in
turn
by
a
later
flock
of
unscrupulous
raptors
.

Or
perhaps
Wall
Street
,
when
it
has
suffered
enough
,
will
realize
that
finance
is
a
service
industry
,
and
change
its
ethos
.

Corp.
to
10.62
%
from
10.43
%
of
the
aerospace

.

In

filing
,
Mr.
Simmons
said
he
and
companies
he
controls
,
NL

Inc.
and

Inc.
,
hold
6,744,600
shares
of

They
include
122,700

,
Lockheed
closed
at

,
down
12.5
cents
.

Earlier
this
week
,
Mr.
Simmons
objected
to
published
reports
quoting
him
as
saying
he
planned
to
sell
his
Lockheed
stake
because
``
the
defense
industry
seems
to
be
getting
more
uncertain
.
''

Valhi
Inc.
,
another
of
Mr.
Simmons
'

,
responded
to
an
article
Monday
in
The
Wall
Street
Journal
,
which
credited
a
story
in
the
Sunday
Los
Angeles
Daily
News
.

Valhi
said
the
articles
did
n't
accurately
reflect
Valhi
and
its
affiliates
'
intentions
toward
Lockheed
.

Instead
,
Valhi
said
,
they
may
increase
,
decrease
or
retain
their
Lockheed

,
depending
on
a
number

Canada
,
which
is
preparing
to
speed
up
tariff
cuts
with
the
U.S.
,
recorded
a
47
%
narrowing
in
its
trade
surplus
with
the
U.S.
in
August
,
Statistics
Canada
,
a
federal
agency
,
reported
.

U.S.
exports
to
Canada
jumped
11.2
%
in
August
from
July
while
U.S.
imports
from
Canada
rose
only
2.7
%
.

As
a
result
,
Canada
's
trade
surplus
with
the
U.S.
narrowed
to
C$
656.5
million
(
US$
558
million
)
in
August
from
C$
1.23
billion
(
US$
1.04
billion
)
in
July
.

U.S.
exports
benefited
in
August
from
heavy
Canadian
spending
on
new
plant
and
equipment
and
a
pickup
in
Canadian
auto
demand
,
Canadian
officials
said
.

The
U.S.
and
Canada
,
which
do
more
trade
than
any
other
pair
of
nations
,
are
to
meet
next
month
to
arrange
an
acceleration
of
planned
tariff
cuts
under
the
U.S.-Canada
free
trade
agreement
.

Industries
in
both
countries
have
requested
a
speedup
of
tariff
cuts
on
hundreds
of
products
.

Some
tariffs
were
eliminated
when
the
trade
pact
took
effect
Jan.
1
.

The
remainder
were
to
be
phased
out
in
five
or
10
annual
installments
,
with
all
tariffs
eliminated
by
January
1998
.

The
two
countries
aim
to
reach
an
agreement
by
early
December
on
a
package
of
accelerated
tariff
cuts
that
would
take
effect
early
next
year
.

Canadian
officials
said
the
trade
pact
has
kindled
an
export
interest
among
many
small
Canadian
companies
that
previously
had
little
or
no
foreign
sales
.

For
such
businessmen
,
the
Canadian
government
is
organizing
55
missions
this
year
to
U.S.
states
bordering
on
Canada
.

The
businessmen
are
introduced
to
potential
agents
and
distributors
and
instructed
in
trade
procedures
.

The
U.S.
Commerce
Department
is
planning
to
try
out
similar
trips
on
U.S.
businessmen
in
coming
months
under
its
Canada
First
!
Outreach
Program
.

Participants
in
the
U.S.
missions
to
Canada
are
to
be
assisted
by
members
of
the
Service
Corps
of
Retired
Executives
,
a
volunteer
group
,
in
dealing
with
their
export
challenges
.

The
Canadian
government
also
has
recently
opened
new
trade
offices
in
San
Diego
;
San
Juan
,
Puerto
Rico
;
Miami
;
Princeton
,
N.J.
,
and
Denver
,
bringing
the
total
number
of
such
Canadian
offices
in
the
U.S.
to
27
.

The
U.S.
has
six
trade
promotion
offices
in
Canada
.

Canada
's
export
effort
has
been
blunted
by
robust
home
market
demand
and
by
an
18
%
appreciation
of
the
Canadian
dollar
against
its
U.S.
counterpart
in
the
past
three
years
that
has
made
Canadian
goods
more
costly
in
the
U.S.
.

Canada
's
trade
surplus
with
all
countries
narrowed
to
C$
203.5
million
in
August
from
C$
528.3
million
in
July
,
Statistics
Canada
said
.

Loral
Corp.
said
it
received
a
$
325
million
order
from
Turkey
's
Ministry
of
Defense
,
the
largest
contract
the
company
ever
has
received
.

Loral
will
provide
to
Turkey
an
electronic
countermeasures
system
for
its
fleet
of
F-16
aircraft
.

The
system
provides
radar-threat
warning
and
electronic
jamming
capabilities
.

The
defense
electronics
maker
said
delivery
will
begin
in
October
1991
and
run
through
mid-1995
.

Loral
said
the
contract
with
Turkey
will
provide
opportunities
for
Loral
to
supply
that
country
with
other
defense
systems
.

Crown
Resources
Corp.
said
it
reached
a
definitive
agreement
to
acquire
the
Gold
Texas
Resources
Ltd.
shares
it
does
n't
already
own
.

Under
the
proposed
agreement
,
Gold
Texas
holders
will
receive
1.43
Crown
shares
for
each
of
the
1.1
million
Gold
Texas
shares
not
owned
by
Crown
,
which
already
owns
65
%
.

The
arrangement
is
subject
to
approval
by
the
Supreme
Court
of
British
Columbia
province
,
Crown
said
.

Gold
Texas
is
based
in
Vancouver

,
and
Crown

is
based
in
Denver
.

Both
are

Apogee

Inc.
said
its
board
extended
until
Feb.

the
exercise
period
of

purchase
warrants
outstanding
.

The
expiration
date
had
been
Nov.
3
.

Each
of
the
1,075,000
warrants
entitle
the
holders
to
purchase
one
share
of
Apogee
common
stock
for
$
2.25

Bank
of
New
England
Corp.
,
seeking
to
streamline
its
business
after
a
year
of
weak
earnings
and
mounting
loan
problems
,
said
it
will
sell
some
operations
and
lay
off
4
%
of
its
work
force
.

The
bank
holding
company
also
reported
that
third-quarter
profit
dropped
41
%
,
to
$
42.7
million
,
or
61
cents
a
share
,
from
the
year-earlier
$
72.3
million
,
or
$
1.04
a
share
.

Among
its
restructuring
measures
,
the
company
said
it
plans
to
sell
53
of
its
453
branch
offices
and
to
lay
off
800
employees
.

Altogether
,
employment
is
expected
to
decline
to
less
than
16,000
from
the
current
level
of
about
18,000
.

Walter
Connolly
,
chairman
,
said
in
an
interview
that
the
company
expects
to
record
pretax
gains
of
$
100
million
to
$
125
million
from
the
sale
of
its
leasing
operations
and
of
certain
financial
processing
services
.

In
a
prepared
statement
,
the
company
said
it
expects
to
realize
those
gains
before
year
end
.

Nonperforming
assets
continued
to
pile
up
in
the
latest
quarter
,
rising
to
$
900
million
,
or
3.52
%
of
loans
and
leases
,
from
$
667
million
,
or
2.68
%
,
at
the
end
of
the
second
quarter
.

Some
$
170
million
of
the
$
233
million
increase
in
nonperforming
loans
was
related
to
real
estate
,
and
roughly
three-quarters
of
that
was
in
the
troubled
New
England
market
,
according
to
Richard
Driscoll
,
vice
chairman
.

Mr.
Driscoll
said
that
,
despite
continued
weakness
in
the
region
's
real
estate
market
,
Bank
of
New
England
expects
the
rate
of
increase
in
nonperforming
assets
to
slow
in
coming
quarters
.

Mr.
Connolly
noted
that
net
third-quarter
charge-offs
,
at
$
63
million
,
improved
slightly
from
the
$
67
million
in
the
second
quarter
.

And
he
indicated
that
more
substantial
improvement
is
expected
in
the
next
couple
of
quarters
.

The
company
increased
its
loan
loss
reserve
to
$
354
million
from
$
342
million
at
the
end
of
the
second
quarter
.

Total
assets
slipped
to
$
31.4
billion
,
from
$
32
billion
as
of
June
30
.

Among
other
restructuring
measures
,
the
bank
said
it
will
close
its
loan
production
offices
in
Chicago
,
New
York
and
Philadelphia
.

The
Chicago
office
figured
prominently
in
the
bank
's
problems
earlier
this
year
,
when
$
65
million
in
loans
to
Chicago
businessman
William
Stoecker
went
sour
.

In
an
internal
memorandum
to
employees
,
Messrs.
Connolly
and
Driscoll
described
the
restructuring
as
an
effort
to
continue
rationalizing
operations
assembled
during
a
series
of
mergers
over
the
past
five
years
.

Italy
's
wholesale
price
index
rose
0.4
%
in
August
from
July
and
was
up
6.1
%
from
a
year
earlier
,
the
state
statistical
institute
reported
.

The
index
registered
196.1
in
August
,
compared
with
195.4
in
July
and
with
184.9
in
August
1988
.

The
year-on-year
rise
in
August
was
slightly
down
from
the
6.4
%
rate
in
July
.

The
index
has
a
base
of

set
in

U.S.
steel
imports
in
August
fell
14
%
from
a
year
earlier
to
1,531,000
tons
,
according
to
the
American
Iron
and
Steel
Institute
.

The
trade
group
's
compilation
of
Commerce
Department
data
showed
that
August
imports
,
the
second
largest
monthly
total
of
the
year
,
were
up
5
%
from
July
's
1,458,000
tons
but
below
last
year
's
high
of
1,979,000
tons
in
June
1988
.

August
imports
claimed
18.5
%
of
the
U.S.
market
,
compared
with
19.3
%
in
July
and
20.5
%
in
August
1988
.

The
latest
month
's
figures
show
that
imports
of
steel
from
European
Community
nations
fell
to
466,000
tons
from
481,000
a
month
earlier
,
while
imports
from
Japan
rose
to
323,000
tons
from
288,000
in
July
.

Imports
from
Canada
rose
to
272,000
tons
in
August
from
209,000
in
July
.

The
American
Institute
for
Imported
Steel
said
imports
for
the
first
eight
months
of
1989
were
below
the
level
allowed
by
the
Voluntary
Restraint
Agreement
program
.

The
institute
said
that
,
excluding
semifinished
steel
products
,
year-to-date
imports
represented
15.2
%
of
consumption
,
compared
with
a
permitted
maximum
of
18.5
%
.

Japanese
machinery
makers
received
orders
totaling
1.465
trillion
yen
(
$
10.33
billion
)
in
August
,
up
14
%
from
a
year
earlier
,
the
Economic
Planning
Agency
said
.

``
Equipment
orders
on
the
domestic
side
were
particularly
strong
in
shipping
and
power
utilities
,
''
said
an
agency
official
.

The
latest
report
compares
with
a
modest
9.9
%
increase
in
July
machinery
orders
from
a
year
earlier
.

In
August
,
soon
after
Wang
Laboratories
Inc.
reported
a
staggering
$
424.3
million
loss
and
replaced
its
president
,
two
Boston
sales
representatives
sent
customers
a
letter
saying
:
``
We
fully
expect
that
you
will
soon
be
reading
stories
in
the
press
reporting
the
`
Amazing
Comeback
at
Wang
.
'
''

How
soon
Wang
will
stage
a
comeback
,
or
if
it
will
at
all
,
are
still
matters
of
debate
.

But
Wang
salespeople
are
trying
to
cope
with
the
biggest
challenge
any
marketer
can
face
:
selling
the
products
of
a
company
that
is
on
the
ropes
.

``
If
your
prospect
is
feeling
risk
the
whole
time
and
you
're
not
feeling
as
if
you
're
backed
up
by
a
stable
company
,
you
've
lost
it
before
you
've
begun
,
''
says
Mary
Ann
Cluggish
,
a
Wellesley
,
Mass.
,
sales
trainer
and
consultant
who
works
with
high
technology
companies
.

It
can
happen
in
any
industry
.

Consider
the
difficulties
faced
by
Audi
salespeople
when
the
car
was
tainted
by
false
charges
of
sudden
acceleration
,
or
Exxon
dealers
'
problems
in
the
wake
of
the
Valdez
oil
spill
.

Like
thousands
of
salespeople
before
them
,
Wang
's
are
finding
ways
to
combat
the
bad
news
.

``
It
's
very
important
that
we
exude
confidence
,
even
though
within
the
family
we
know
there
's
a
lot
of
hard
work
ahead
,
''
said
Richard
Miller
,
the
Lowell
,
Mass.
,
computer
concern
's
new
president
,
in
a
video
message
to
salespeople
a
month
after
he
took
over
.

Wang
got
into
financial
trouble
because
of
bloated
overhead
and
overly
optimistic
sales
forecasts
.

Its
mainline
minicomputers
and
word
processors
have
lost
ground
to
cheaper
personal
computers
.

Last
year
it
funded
its
high
employment
by
heavy
borrowing
,
and
it
suffered
huge
losses
when
sales
turned
down
instead
of
rising
.

After
the
company
reported
red
ink
for
the
fiscal
third
quarter
,
Wang
's
marketing
department
provided
the
sales
force
answers
to
questions
such
as
``
How
could
you
not
have
known
you
were
going
to
lose
$
55
million
?
''
and
``
Is
Wang
still
a
viable
company
?
''

Salespeople
try
to
push
their
products
and
avoid
discussions
of
finances
.

Responding
to
such
questions
is
``
defensive
,
''
says
Kenneth
Olissa
,
Wang
's
vice
president
,
marketing
.

``
That
's
antithetical
to
the
art
of
selling
.
''

Moreover
,
he
notes
that
analyzing
financial
results
``
poses
a
problem
for
a
salesman
who
is
n't
particularly
familiar
with
a
balance
sheet
.
''

At
one
sales
strategy
meeting
,
an
executive
suggested
ordering
salespeople
to
become
experts
on
the
annual
report
.

Mr.
Miller
vetoed
that
:
``
Even
I
ca
n't
understand
all
the
footnotes
,
''
he
says
.

Instead
,
he
says
,
if
the
salespeople
can
get
the
customers
to
consider
Wang
's
products
on
their
merits
,
he
or
a
top
financial
officer
will
try
to
assuage
the
fears
about
finances
.

Mike
Metschan
,
a
salesman
in
Wang
's
Austin
,
Texas
,
office
,
has
a
breezier
method
:
``
We
tell
them
$
3
billion
companies
do
n't
go
out
of
business
.

We
tell
them
all
the
major
companies
are
having
financial
difficulties
.
''

Numerous
computer
companies
are
having
sales
slumps
and
earnings
declines
,
but
very
few
have
had
losses
comparable
to
Wang
's
or
are
carrying
such
a
large
debt
load
.

Mr.
Miller
says
that
after
a
sharp
sales
slump
in
July
and
August
,
sales
stabilized
in
September
.

Although
Wang
will
report
a
loss
for
the
first
quarter
ended
Sept.
30
and
the
full
fiscal
year
,
Mr.
Miller
says
he
expects
the
company
will
return
to
profitability
by
the
fourth
quarter
.

Experts
on
sales
technique
say
anyone
representing
a
troubled
company
must
walk
a
fine
line
.

``
If
a
salesman
jeopardizes
his
credibility
in
this
time
of
trouble
,
it
will
be
a
problem
for
the
long
run
,
''
says
George
Palmatier
,
a
Minden
,
Nev.
,
sales
consultant
and
author
of
``
The
Marketing
Edge
.
''

Still
,
says
John
Sullivan
,
a
management
recruiter
with
Daniel
Roberts
Inc.
of
Boston
,
who
has
held
senior
sales
positions
at
Polaroid
and
Atari
:
``
The
customer
will
react
to
strength
.

Ignore
the
present
condition
.

Show
it
's
business
as
usual
.
''

That
is
n't
easy
.

Wang
's
customers
are
data
processing
managers
who
want
to
be
sure
that
their
suppliers
are
stable
,
wellrun
companies
that
will
be
around
to
fix
bugs
and
upgrade
computers
for
years
to
come
.

For
buyers
,
``
these
are
career-risking
decisions
,
''
says
Jean
Conlin
,
who
supervises
a
network
of
Wang
computers
in
the
admissions
department
at
Boston
University
.

The
university
is
considering
installing
a
$
250,000
system
to
store
applications
electronically
.

``
Before
the
really
bad
news
,
we
were
looking
at
Wang
fairly
seriously
,
''
she
says
.

But
``
their
present
financial
condition
means
I
'd
have
a
hard
time
convincing
the
vice
president
in
charge
of
purchasing
.
''

Ms.
Conlin
adds
:
``
At
some
point
we
'd
have
to
ask
,
`
How
do
we
know
that
in
three
years
you
wo
n't
be
in
Chapter
11
?
'
''

During
the
past
year
,
Wang
has
developed
new
products
and
a
new
strategy
and
hired
a
new
president
.

Wang
's
overall
product
line
is
``
still
not
as
good
as
other
vendors
,
but
they
've
come
a
long
way
,
''
says
Steven
Wendler
,
a
consultant
with
market
researcher
Gartner
Group
,
Stamford
,
Conn
.

``
They
were
on
the
road
to
recovery
in
terms
of
customer
attitudes
until
this
bad
quarter
happened
.
''

The
first
priority
for
Wang
's
sales
force
is
to
make
sure
it
holds
on
to
existing
customers
.

Wang
's
installed
base
is
one
of
its
greatest
assets
,
and
many
of
those
customers
remain
extremely
loyal
.

But
even
before
Wang
's
latest
financial
troubles
surfaced
,
some
customers
``
were
trying
to
wall
off
their
Wang
installations
''
so
other
departments
would
n't
add
Wang
,
says
Chris
Christiansen
,
a
former
Wang
marketer
who
is
now
a
market
analyst
with
Meta
Group
,
a
market
research
firm
in
Stamford
,
Conn
.

One
Wang
salesman
who
left
the
company
in
July
recalls
that
when
he
tried
to
sell
products
to
Eastman
Kodak
,
he
worked
``
to
muster
support
from
internal
allies
,
''
but
``
those
allies
became
skeptical
as
they
saw
the
downtrend
.

The
more
recent
losses
were
really
devastating
.
''

New
customers
,
the
source
of
higher
commissions
for
salespeople
and
the
key
to
Wang
's
long-term
viability
,
are
even
tougher
.

Rick
Lynch
,
a
former
top
salesman
in
Wang
's
Boston
office
,
referring
to
Wang
's
mainstay
computer
line
,
says
:
``
You
ca
n't
sell
a
VS
to
a
new
customer
.
''

Mr.
Lynch
left
Wang
this
summer
for
Oracle
Systems
Inc.
,
a
software
vendor
.

The
financial
problems
are
particularly
frustrating
for
salespeople
pushing
Wang
's
image
systems
,
which
convert
paper
forms
to
electronic
documents
.

Consultants
say
that
Wang
's
technology
is
among
the
best
available
in
the
image
market
.

But
salespeople
often
found
that
news
of
Wang
's
problems
superseded
their
sales
efforts
.

William
Tait
,
a
former
sales
manager
in
Indianapolis
,
says
that
his
office
had
all
but
sold
a
$
1.5
million
image
system
to
pharmaceutical
maker
Eli
Lilly
&
Co
.

``
When
they
were
making
the
decision
,
all
hell
broke
loose
with
the
finances
.
''

He
says
the
Lilly
executives
told
him
they
could
n't
take
the
risk
with
Wang
.

Mr.
Tait
say
he
does
n't
blame
Lilly
.

Buyers
have
to
rely
on
a
supplier
``
continually
upgrading
and
replacing
the
product
,
''
he
says
.

``
When
a
company
realizes
that
,
it
's
hard
to
go
with
Wang
.
''

For
Mr.
Tait
,
who
says
he
used
to
earn
as
much
as
$
150,000
a
year
at
Wang
,
it
was
one
more
reason
to
quit
.

He
is
now
president
of
Eastate
Homes
Inc.
,
an
Indianapolis
contractor
.

It
can
be
hard
for
a
salesperson
to
fight
off
feelings
of
discouragement
.

Brian
Petre
,
a
former
Wang
salesman
in
upstate
New
York
,
says
:
``
You
have
pride
in
your
job
.

You
think
you
can
go
out
and
turn
things
around
.

It
's
a
tough
thing
when
you
ca
n't
.

The
reason
does
n't
relate
to
your
selling
skills
.
''

Discouragement
feeds
on
itself
.

``
The
problem
is
,
if
people
get
down
in
the
dumps
,
they
stop
selling
,
''
says
Mike
Durcan
,
a
laid-off
sales
manager
in
Wang
's
Austin
office
.

One
key
for
salespeople
is
to
boost
their
own
morale
.

Paul
Hellman
,
a
Framingham
,
Mass.
,
sales
and
management
consultant
and
author
of
``
Ready
,
Aim
,
You
're
Hired
,
''
says
:
``
The
bad
news
is
,
you
'll
be
rejected
more
.

The
good
news
is
,
it
's
not
your
fault
.
''

So
,
he
advises
,
make
goals
achievable
.

For
instance
,
he
suggests
that
salespeople
making
telephone
calls
should
say
to
themselves
:
``
All
I
want
to
do
today
is
get
50
rejections
.
''

But
Mr.
Miller
,
Wang
's
new
president
,
recently
warned
his
salespeople
about
negativism
.

``
Our
customers
watch
us
for
the
hidden
message
,
''
he
said
.

``
Look
a
customer
right
in
the
eye
and
say
,
`
I
'm
glad
to
be
at
Wang
.

Blinder
International
Enterprises
Inc.
,
the
parent
of
beleaguered
penny-stockbroker
Blinder
,
Robinson
&
Co.
,
said
its
shareholders
approved
a
previously
announced
name
change
to
Intercontinental
Enterprises
Inc
.

``
The
parent
company
is
diversifying
into
other
industries
around
the
world
,
''
said
president
Meyer
Blinder
in
explaining
the
name
change
.

``
Everytime
we
talked
about
Blinder
International
,
{
people
}
thought
it
was
the
brokerage
house
.
''

Mr.
Blinder
said
the
change
was
n't
related
to
the
brokerage
's
recent
troubles
,
which
have
included
sharp
declines
in
earnings
,
run-ins
with
the
securities
regulators
and
lawsuits
by
former
customers
.

The
company
said
it
expects
the
name
change
to
take
effect
within
a
week
.

Olin
Corp.
said
third-quarter
net
income
rose
26
%
on
the
strength
of
its
chemical
business
.

Net
was
$
24
million
,
or
$
1.15
a
share
,
up
from
$
19
million
,
or
90
cents
a
share
,
a
year
earlier
.

Sales
rose
7.4
%
to
$
580
million
from
$
540
million
.

Olin
said
its
chemical
segment
had
profit
of
$
22
million
,
up
from
$
15
million
a
year
ago
,
largely
because
of
gains
in
electrochemicals
such
as
caustic
soda
.

The
company
said
the
gains
were
tied
to
volume
increases
and
higher
prices
.

The
market
for
electrochemicals
include
the
paper
,
water-purification
and
textile
industries
.

The
chemical
segment
had
a
$
6
million
gain
on
the
sale
of
ammonia
and
urea
businesses
,
which
was
offset
by
a
$
6
million
charge
for
future
environmental
expenditures
.

Profit
in
Olin
's
defense
and
ammunition
segment
rose
to
$
8
million
from
$
7
million
.

The
metals
segment
,
hurt
by
a
strike
,
had
break-even
results
,
against
$
3
million
a
year
ago
.

In
the
first
nine
months
,
net
rose
21
%
to
$
93
million
,
or
$
4.52
a
share
,
from
$
77
million
,
or
$
3.62
a
share
a
year
ago
.

Sales
rose
13
%
to
$
1.91
billion
from
$
1.69
billion
.

In

closed
at

down

GTE
Corp.
and
MCI
Communications
Corp.
reported
strong
earnings
gains
to
record
levels
for
the
third
quarter
.

Southwestern
Bell
Corp.
and
Cincinnati
Bell
posted
slight
declines
.

GTE
Corp
.

GTE
said
net
income
rose
18
%
,
aided
by
higher
long-distance
calling
volumes
and
an
increase
in
telephone
lines
in
service
.

Pretax
operating
profit
from
telephone
operations
rose
8.2
%
but
profits
from
telecommunications
products
and
electrical
products
were
flat
.

Revenues
rose
8.8
%
to
$
4.35
billion
from
$
4.0
billion
.

The
company
said
the
quarter
included
a
10
%
increase
in
local-exchange
usage
for
long-distance
calling
and
a
5
%
increase
in
the
number
of
access
lines
in
service
.

Earlier
rate
reductions
in
Texas
and
California
reduced
the
quarter
's
revenue
and
operating
profit
$
55
million
;
a
year
earlier
,
operating
profit
in
telephone
operations
was
reduced
by
a
similar
amount
as
a
result
of
a
provision
for
a
reorganization
.

Revenue
in
the
telecommunications
products
and
services
unit
rose
27
%
to
$
728.8
million
,
but
operating
profit
was
unchanged
at
$
26.3
million
,
partly
because
of
start-up
expenses
.

Electrical
products
'
sales
fell
to
$
496.7
million
from
$
504.5
million
with
higher
world-wide
lighting
volume
offset
by
lower
domestic
prices
and
the
impact
of
weaker
currencies
in
Europe
and
South
America
.

Operating
profit
of
$
37.2
million
was
unchanged
.

In
composite
trading
on
the
New

GTE
rose

MCI
Communications
Corp
.

MCI
,
which
stepped
up
efforts
to
sell
long-distance
telephone
service
to
residential
customers
,
reported
a
59
%
jump
in
earnings
.

Revenue
rose
23
%
to
$
1.67
billion
from
$
1.36
billion
.

Operating
profit
grew
57
%
to
$
269
million
from
$
171
million
,
while
operating
margins
rose
to
16.1
%
from
15.9
%
the
previous
quarter
and
12.6
%
a
year
ago
.

Daniel
Akerson
,
MCI
chief
financial
officer
,
said
the
company
sees
further
improvements
in
operating
margins
.

``
We
think
we
can
take
it
to
the
18
%
range
over
next
18
to
24
months
,
''
he
said
.

In
national
over-the-counter

,
MCI
fell

to
$
42.375
.

Charles
Schellke
,
an
analyst
with
Smith
Barney
,
Harris
Upham
&
Co.
,
said
some
investors
apparently
expected
slightly
better
revenue
growth
.

The
company
said
that
residential
traffic
grew
faster
than
business
traffic
and
attributed
that
to
its
new
PrimeTime
calling
plan
that
competes
with
American
Telephone
&
Telegraph
's
Reach
Out
America
plan
.

MCI
claims
about
12
%
of
the
overall
long-distance
telephone
market
but
just
under
10
%
of
the
$
23
billion
residential
market
.

It
has
been
trying
to
improve
its
share
of
the
residential
market
.

The
company
wants
its
business
mix
to
more
closely
match
that
of
AT&T
--
a
step
it
says
will
help
prevent
cross
subsidization
.

Mr.
Akerson
said
MCI
recorded
``
another
solid
cash
positive
quarter
,
''
its
fourth
in
a
row
,
but
declined
to
comment
on
whether
the
company
is
considering
a
dividend
or
is
planning
any
acquisition
.

The
current
quarter
,
he
said
,
``
looks
fine
.

We
think
revenue
will
continue
to
grow
and
that
we
can
control
costs
and
thus
improve
profitability
.

Southwestern
Bell
Corp
.

Southwestern
Bell
Corp.
said
net
dropped
8.7
%
,
mainly
the
result
of
four
extraordinary
items
:
a
franchise
tax
refund
that
its
Southwestern
Bell
Telephone
Co.
unit
received
last
year
;
a
production
shift
of
several
Yellow
Pages
directories
to
the
fourth
quarter
from
the
third
;
a
rate
refund
in
Missouri
and
a
one-time
adjustment
to
phone
company
revenues
.

Revenue
slipped
1.2
%
to
$
2.21
billion
from
$
2.23

.

The
earnings
drop
had
been
expected
.

Chairman
Zane
E.
Barnes
said
Southwestern
Bell
's
``

The

reported
a
3.1

increase
in
the
number
of
access

,
and
also
said
its
Southwestern
Bell
Mobile

unit
added
30,000
new

Cincinnati
Bell
Inc
.

Cincinnati
Bell

said
net
declined
1.8
%

The
company
noted
that
the
year-ago
period
was
particularly
strong
,
with
an
increase
of
nearly
70
%
.

Revenue
jumped
nearly
17

In

Cincinnati
Bell
fell

The
company
said
that
the
number
of
access
lines
dropped
slightly
in
the
quarter
,
a
decline
attributed
to
seasonal
fluctuations
.

For
the
year
,
however
,
access
lines
in

have
increased
5.5
%
.

Chairman
D.H.
Hibbard
said
the

has
set
a
new
five
year
goal
of
doubling
revenues
to
about
$
1.8
billion

steadily
increasing

Thomas
E.
Meador
,
42
years
old
,
was
named
president
and
chief
operating
officer
of
Balcor
Co.
,
a
Skokie
,
Ill.
,
subsidiary
of
this
New
York
investment
banking
firm
.

Balcor
,
which
has
interests
in
real
estate
,
said
the
position
is
newly
created
.

Mr.
Meador
had
been
executive
vice
president
of
Balcor
.

In
addition
to
his
previous
real-estate
investment
and
asset-management
duties
,
Mr.
Meador
takes
responsibility
for
development
and
property
management
.

Those
duties
had
been
held
by

who
resigned
as

Shearson

Great
American
Bank
,
citing
depressed
Arizona
real
estate
prices
,
posted
a
third-quarter
loss
of
$
59.4
million
,
or
$
2.48
a
share
.

A
year
earlier
,
the
savings
bank
had
earnings
of
$
8.1
million
,
or
33
cents
a
share
.

For
the
nine
months
,
it
had
a
loss
of
$
58.3
million
,
or
$
2.44
a
share
,
after
earnings
of
$
29.5
million
,
or
$
1.20
a
share
,
in
the
1988
period
.

Great
American
said
it
increased
its
loan-loss
reserves
by
$
93
million
after
reviewing
its
loan
portfolio
,
raising
its
total
loan
and
real
estate
reserves
to
$
217
million
.

Before
the
loan-loss
addition
,
it
said
,
it
had
operating
profit
of
$
10
million
for
the
quarter
.

The
move
followed
a
round
of
similar
increases
by
other
lenders
against
Arizona
real
estate
loans
,
reflecting
a
continuing
decline
in
that
market
.

In
addition
to
the
increased
reserve
,
the
savings
bank
took
a
special
charge
of
$
5
million
representing
general
and
administrative
expenses
from
staff
reductions
and
other
matters
,
and
it
posted
a
$
7.6
million
reduction
in
expected
mortgage
servicing
fees
,
reflecting
the
fact
that
more
borrowers
are
prepaying
their
mortgages
.

Arbitragers
were
n't
the
only
big
losers
in
the
collapse
of
UAL
Corp.
stock
.

Look
at
what
happened
to
UAL
's
chairman
,
Stephen
M.
Wolf
,
and
its
chief
financial
officer
,
John
C.
Pope
.

On
a
day
some
United
Airlines
employees
wanted
Mr.
Wolf
fired
and
takeover
stock
speculators
wanted
his
scalp
,
Messrs.
Wolf
and
Pope
saw
their
prospective
personal
fortunes
continue
to
plummet
as
shares
of
UAL
,
United
's
parent
company
,
dived
$
24.875
on
the
Big
Board
to
close
at
$
198
.

Including
Monday
's
plunge
,
that
has
given
the
two
executives
paper
losses
of
$
49.5
million
,
based
on
what
they
would
have
realized
had
the
pilots
and
management-led
buy-out
of
UAL
gone
through
at
$
300
a
share
.

When
bank
financing
for
the
buy-out
collapsed
last
week
,
so
did
UAL
's
stock
.

Even
if
the
banks
resurrect
a
financing
package
at
$
250
a
share
,
the
two
executives
would
still
get
about
$
25
million
less
than
they
stood
to
gain
in
the
initial
transaction
.

Mr.
Wolf
owns
75,000
UAL
shares
and
has
options
to
buy
another
250,000
at
$
83.3125
each
.

In
the
$
300-a-share
buyout
,
that
totaled
about
$
76.7
million
.

By
yesterday
's
close
of
trading
,
it
was
good
for
a
paltry
$
43.5
million
.

Of
course
,
Mr.
Wolf
,
48
years
old
,
has
some
savings
.

He
left
his
last
two
jobs
at
Republic
Airlines
and
Flying
Tiger
with
combined
stock-option
gains
of
about
$
22
million
,
and
UAL
gave
him
a
$
15
million
bonus
when
it
hired
him
.

His
1988
salary
was
$
575,000
,
with
a
$
575,000
bonus
.

The
40-year
old
Mr.
Pope
has
n't
changed
jobs
enough
--
at
least
the
right
ones
--
to
stash
away
that
kind
of
money
.

United
paid
him
a
$
375,000
bonus
to
lure
him
away
from
American
Airlines
,
and
he
was
paid
a
salary
of
$
342,122
last
year
with
a
$
280,000
bonus
.

Mr.
Pope
owns
10,000
UAL
shares
and
has
options
to
buy
another
150,000
at
$
69
each
.

That
came
to
a
combined
$
37.7
million
under
the
$
300-a-share
buy-out
,
but
just
$
21.3
million
at
yesterday
's
close
.

Of
the
combined
$
114.4
million
the
two
men
were
scheduled
to
reap
under
the
buy-out
,
they
agreed
to
invest
in
the
buy-out
just
$
15
million
,
angering
many
of
the
thousands
of
workers
asked
to
make
pay
concessions
so
the
buy-out
would
be
a
success
.

United
's
directors
voted
themselves
,
and
their
spouses
,
lifetime
access
to
the
Friendly
Skies
--
free
first-class
travel
,
and
$
20,000
a
year
for
life
as
well
.

Conceivably
,
in
a
scaled-back
buy-out
,
they
could
be
bumped
back
to
coach
seats
for
life
.

Thomas
H.
Johnson
,
president
of
the
Coatedboard
division
of
Mead
Corp.
,
was
named
president
of
Manville
Forest
Products
Corp.
,
a

.

Mr.
Johnson
succeeds
Harry

in

Manville
is
a

US
Facilities
Corp.
said
Robert
J.
Percival
agreed
to
step
down
as
vice
chairman
of
the
insurance
holding
company
.

``
There
was
a
difference
of
opinion
as
to
the
future
direction
of
the
company
,
''
a
spokeswoman
said
.

Mr.
Percival
declined
to
comment
.

In
a
statement
,
US
Facilities
said
Mr.
Percival
's
employment
contract
calls
for
him
to
act
as
a
consultant
to
the
company
for
two
years
.

He
will
also
remain
a
director
,
US
Facilities
said
,
but
wo
n't
serve
on
any
board
committees
.

Mr.
Percival
will
be
succeeded
on
an
interim
basis
by
George
Kadonada
,
US
Facilities
chairman
and
president
.

In
the
same
statement
,
US
Facilities
also
said
it
had
bought
back
112,000
of
its
common
shares
in
a
private
transaction
.

Terms
were
n't
disclosed
.

The
buy-back
represents
about
3
%
of
the
company
's
shares
,
based
on
the
3.7
million
shares
outstanding
as
of
Sept.

.

In

Three
leading
drug
companies
reported
robust
third-quarter
earnings
,
bolstered
by
strong
sales
of
newer
,
big-selling
prescriptions
drugs
that
provide
hefty
profit
margins
.

Merck

reported
a
25

;
Warner-Lambert

's
profit
rose
22
%
and
Eli

The
results
were
in
line
with
analysts
'
expectations
.

Merck
&
Co
.

Merck
,
Rahway
,
N.J.
,
continued
to
lead
the
industry
with
a
strong
sales
performance
in
the
human
and
animal
health-products
segment
.

A
stronger
U.S.
dollar
reduced
third-quarter
and
first-nine-month
sales
growth
2
%
and
3
%
,
respectively
.

International
sales
accounted
for
47
%
of
total
company
sales
for
the
nine
months
,
compared
with
50
%
a
year
earlier
.

Sales
for
the
quarter
rose
to
$
1.63
billion
from
$
1.47
billion
.

Mevacor
,
Merck
's
new
cholesterol-lowering
drug
,
had
higher
sales
than
any
other
prescription
medicine
has
ever
achieved
in
the
U.S.
in
the
year
following
introduction
,
the
company
said
.

The
drug
was
introduced
in
West
Germany
this
year
.

Intense
competition
,
however
,
led
to
unit
sales
declines
for
a
group
of
Merck
's
established
human
and
animal-health
products
,
including
Aldomet
and
Indocin
.

In

Warner-Lambert
,
Morris

,
reported
sales
that
were
a
record
for
any
quarter
and
the
eighth
quarter
in
a
row
of
20
%
or
more
per-share
earnings
growth
.

Spurred
by
growth
in
world-wide
sales
of
the
company
's
prescription
drugs
,
Warner-Lambert
said
1989
will
be
the
best
year
in
its
history
,
with
per-share
earnings
expected
to
increase
more
than
20
%
to
about
$
6.10
.

Sales
for
the
quarter
rose
to
$
1.11
billion
from
$
1.03
billion
.

Prescription-drug
world-wide
sales
rose
9
%
in
the
quarter
to
$
340
million
;
U.S.
sales
rose
15
%
.

The
segment
's
growth
was
led
by
sales
of
the
cardiovascular
drugs
Lopid
,
a
lipid
regulator
,
and
Dilzem
,
a
calcium
channel
blocker
.

World-wide

non-prescription
health-care
products
,
such
as
Halls

in
Big

composite
trading
yesterday
.

Eli
Lilly
&
Co
.

Lilly
attributed
record
third-quarter
and
nine-month
results
to
world-wide
gains
for
pharmaceuticals
,
medical
instruments
and
plant-science
products
despite
poor
exchange
rates
for
the
dollar
that
slowed
sales
abroad
.

Earnings
continued
to
pace
sales
because
of
a
lower
tax
rate
,
profit
from
the
renegotiation
of
the
debt
instrument
received
from
Faberge
Inc.
in
connection
with
Lilly
's
sale
of
Elizabeth
Arden
Inc.
in
1987
,
and
net
proceeds
from
the
settlement
of
patent
litigation
at

unit
.

Third-quarter

Nine-month

3.39
billion
from
$
3.03
billion
a
year
earlier
.

Sales
of
Prozac
,
an
anti-depressant
,
led
drug-sales
increases
.

Higher
sales
of
pesticides
and
other
plant-science
products
more
than
offset
a
slight
decline
in
the
sales
of
animal-health
products
to
fuel
the
increase
in
world-wide
agricultural
product
sales
,
Lilly
said
.

Advanced

Reuben
Mark
,
chairman
of
Colgate-Palmolive
Co.
,
said
he
is
``
comfortable
''
with
analysts
'
estimates
that
third-quarter
earnings
rose
to
between
95
cents
and
$
1.05
a
share
.

That
compares
with
per-share
earnings
from
continuing
operations
of
69
cents
the
year
earlier
;
including
discontinued
operations
,
per-share
was
88
cents
a
year
ago
.

The
per-share
estimates
mean
the
consumer-products
company
's
net
income
,
increased
to
between
$
69.5
million
and
$
76
million
,
from
$
47.1
million
the
year-before
period
.

Analysts
estimate
Colgate
's
world-wide
third-quarter
sales
rose
about
8
%
to
$
1.29
billion
.

Mr.
Mark
attributed
the
earnings
growth
to
strong
sales
in
Latin
America
,
Asia
and
Europe
.

Results
were
also
bolstered
by
``
a
very
meaningful
''
increase
in
operating
profit
by
Colgate
's
U.S.
business
,
Mr.
Mark
said
.

Operating
profit
at
Colgate
's
U.S.
household
products
and
personal-care
businesses
jumped
25
%
in
the
quarter
,
Mr.
Mark
added
.

He
said
the
improvement
was
a
result
of
cost
savings
achieved
by
consolidating
manufacturing
operations
,
blending
two
sales
organizations
and
focusing
more
carefully
the
company
's
promotional
activities
.

The
estimated
improvement
in
Colgate
's
U.S.
operations
took
some
analysts
by
surprise
.

Colgate
's
household
products
business
,
which
includes
such
brands
as
Fab
laundry
detergent
and
Ajax
cleanser
,
has
been
a
weak
performer
.

Analysts
estimate
Colgate
's
sales
of
household
products
in
the
U.S.
were
flat
for
the
quarter
,
and
they
estimated
operating
margins
at
only
1
%
to
3
%
.

``
If
you
could
say
their
business
in
the
U.S.
was
mediocre
,
but
great
everywhere
else
,
that
would
be
fine
,
''
says
Bonita
Austin
,
an
analyst
with
Wertheim
Schroder
&
Co
.

``
But
it
's
not
mediocre
,
it
's
a
real
problem
.
''

Mr.
Mark
conceded
that
Colgate
's
domestic
business
,
apart
from
its
highly
profitable
Hill
's
Pet
Products
unit
,
has
lagged
.

``
We
've
done
a
lot
to
improve
{
U.S.
.
}
results
,
and
a
lot
more
will
be
done
,
''
Mr.
Mark
said
.

``
Improving
profitability
of
U.S.
operations
is
an
extremely
high
priority
in
the
company
.
''

To
focus
on
its
global
consumer-products
business
,

Deeply
ingrained

both
the
book
review
``
Kissing
Nature
Good-bye
''
by
Stephen
MacDonald
(
Leisure

Arts
,
Sept.
27
)
and
the
books
reviewed
is
the
assumption
that
global
warming
is
entirely
a
result
of
human
activity
.

Is
such
a
view
justified
?

In
the
absence
of
humans
,
would
the
Earth
enjoy
a
constant
climate
over
the
long
term
?

Clearly
not
.

About
20,000
years
ago
the
last
ice
age
ended
.

Enormous
ice
sheets
retreated
from
the
face
of
North
America
,
northern
Europe
and
Asia
.

This
global
warming
must
have
been
entirely
natural
--
nobody
would
blame
it
on
a
few
hundred
thousand
hunter-gatherers
hunting
mammoths
and
scratching
around
in
caves
.

Furthermore
,
no
bell
has
yet
rung
to
announce
the
end
of
this
immense
episode
of
natural
global
warming
.

It
is
probably
continuing
and
may
well
account
for
most
of
,
or
all
of
,
present-day
global
warming
.

I
bow
to
no
one
in
my
regard
for
our
terrestrial
heritage
,
but
if
we
are
serious
about
global
warming
we
must
look
at
the
big
picture
and
not
allow
the
Dominant
Culture
to
lock
us
into
the
capitalist-exploiters-greedy-American-consumers-global
-
warming
scenario
as
the
sole
model
for
discussion
.

Jocelyn
Tomkin
Astronomy
Department
University
of

The
Internal
Revenue
Service
plans
to
restructure
itself
more
like
a
private
corporation
.

In
addition
,
the
tax-collecting
agency
says
that
it
will
take
the
unusual
step
of
looking
to
the
private
sector
to
fill
two
new
high-level
positions
to
guide
the
120,000-employee
agency
:
a
comptroller
to
oversee
daily
finances
and
a
chief
information
officer
to
update
the
information
system
,
which
includes
probably
the
largest
computer
data
base
in
the
world
.

The
IRS
also
said
that
it
would
create
the
position
of
chief
financial
officer
,
who
will
be
hired
from
within
the
agency
.

IRS
Commissioner
Fred
T.
Goldberg
said
the
changes
are
intended
to
bring
``
accountability
''
to
the
agency
,
which
has
an
annual
budget
of
more
than
$
5
billion
and
collects
about
$
1
trillion
a
year
.

``
My
assessment
and
everyone
's
assessment
is
that
we
do
not
have
the
kinds
of
information
that
let
us
responsibly
and
effectively
formulate
and
execute
our
budget
,
''
Mr.
Goldberg
said
.

``
And
we
do
n't
have
internal
controls
and
discipline
that
we
need
to
have
to
spend
$
5
billion
properly
.
''

Mr.
Goldberg
,
who
took
over
as
head
of
the
IRS
in
July
,
has
been
disturbed
by
what
he
considers
the
inefficiency
,
waste
and
lack
of
coordination
among
the
branches
of
the
vast
federal
agency
.

The
IRS
operates
on
a
computer
system
designed
in
1961
,
which
it
has
been
trying
to
modernize
for
years
.

And
the
agency
,
which
operated
throughout
fiscal
1989
with
a
$
360
million
budget
shortfall
,
has
been
under
a
hiring
freeze
since
last
fall
.

The
new
commissioner
says
that
closer
scrutiny
of
how
the
agency
uses
its
resources
will
go
a
long
way
toward
enhancing
its
ability
to
collect
more
tax
revenue
.

``
I
think
that
you
will
see
a
significant
improvement
in
the
budget
formulation
and
execution
process
which
,
in
turn
,
I
believe
will
result
in
a
significant
increase
in
revenue
,
''
he
said
.

The
IRS
hopes
to
fill
the
new
positions
soon
.

Customarily
,
it
would
appoint
career
civil
servants
from
within
the
agency
,
but
Mr.
Goldberg
said
he
plans
to
``
scour
the
world
''
for
the
chief
information
officer
and
the
comptroller
.

Although
the
jobs
will
probably
pay
between
$
70,000
and
$
80,000
a
year
,
IRS
officials
are
confident
that
they
can
attract
top-notch
candidates
from
the
private
sector
.

``
You
're
telling
someone
they
can
spend
the
next
three
or
four
or
five
or
six
years
of
their
life
bringing
about
the
most
difficult
and
costly
modernization
of
an
information
system
on
the
civil
side
ever
,
''
Mr.
Goldberg
said
.

``
On
the
comptroller
side
,
you
're
developing
and
making
work
financial
controls
governing
a
$
6
billion
budget
.

When
Maj.
Moises
Giroldi
,
the
leader
of
the
abortive
coup
in
Panama
,
was
buried
,
his
body
bore
several
gunshot
wounds
,
a
cracked
skull
and
broken
legs
and
ribs
.

They
were
the
signature
of
his
adversary
,
Panamanian
leader
Manuel
Antonio
Noriega
.

The
rebel
officer
's
slow
and
painful
death
,
at
the
headquarters
of
Panama
's
Battalion-2000
squad
,
was
personally
supervised
by
Gen.
Noriega
,
says
a
U.S.
official
with
access
to
intelligence
reports
.

Leaping
into
rages
,
sinking
into
bouts
of
drunkenness
and
mistrust
,
Mr.
Noriega
has
put
to
death
some
70
of
his
troops
involved
in
the
coup
,
according
to
U.S.
officials
monitoring
crematoriums
and
funeral
parlors
in
Panama
City
.

He
is
now
changing
the
place
he
sleeps
every
night
,
sometimes
more
than
once
a
night
.

His
meals
are
most
often
prepared
by
women
he
trusts
--
his
full-time
mistress
,
Vicky
Amado
,
and
her
mother
,
Norma
.

And
he
is
collecting
the
names
of
those
who
telephoned
the
coup-makers
to
congratulate
them
during
their
brief
time
in
control
of
his
headquarters
.

More
enemies
to
be
dealt
with
.

In
the
two
weeks
since
the
rebellion
,
which
the
U.S.
hesitantly
backed
,
Mr.
Noriega
has
been
at
his
most
brutal
-
and
efficient
-
in
maintaining
power
.

Yet
,
while
the
failed
coup
is
a
major
U.S.
foreign
policy
embarrassment
,
it
is
merely
the
latest
chapter
in
a
byzantine
relationship
between
Mr.
Noriega
and
Washington
that
stretches
back
three
decades
.

America
's
war
on
the
dictator
over
the
past
two
years
,
following
his
indictment
on
drug
charges
in
February
1988
,
is
the
legacy
of
that
relationship
.

Before
American
foreign
policy
set
out
to
destroy
Noriega
,
it
helped
create
him
out
of
the
crucible
of
Panama
's
long
history
of
conspirators
and
pirates
.

For
most
of
the
past
30
years
,
the
marriage
was
one
of
convenience
.

In
1960
,
for
example
,
when
Mr.
Noriega
was
both
a
cadet
at
an
elite
military
academy
in
Peru
and
a
spy-in-training
for
the
U.S.
Defense
Intelligence
Agency
,
he
was
detained
by
Lima
authorities
for
allegedly
raping
and
savagely
beating
a
prostitute
,
according
to
a
U.S.
Embassy
cable
from
that
period
.

The
woman
had
nearly
died
.

But
U.S.
intelligence
,
rather
than
rein
in
or
cut
loose
its
new
spy
,
merely
filed
the
report
away
.

Mr.
Noriega
's
tips
on
emerging
leftists
at
his
school
were
deemed
more
important
to
U.S.
interests
.

From
that
point
on
,
the
U.S.
would
make
a
practice
of
overlooking
the
Panamanian
's
misadventures
.

The
U.S.
has
befriended
and
later
turned
against
many
dictators
,
but
none
quite
so
resourceful
.

The
55-year-old
Mr.
Noriega
is
n't
as
smooth
as
the
shah
of
Iran
,
as
well-born
as
Nicaragua
's
Anastasio
Somoza
,
as
imperial
as
Ferdinand
Marcos
of
the
Philippines
or
as
bloody
as
Haiti
's
Baby
Doc
Duvalier
.

Yet
he
has
proved
more
resilient
than
any
of
them
.

And
out
of
necessity
:
The
U.S.
can
make
mistakes
and
still
hope
to
remove
him
from
power
,
but
a
single
error
on
his
part
could
cost
him
his
life
.

``
The
U.S.
underestimated
Noriega
all
along
,
''
says
Ambler
Moss
,
a
former
Ambassador
to
Panama
.

``
He
has
mastered
the
art
of
survival
.
''

In
keeping
with
America
's
long
history
of
propping
up
Mr.
Noriega
,
recent
U.S.
actions
have
extended
rather
than
shortened
his
survival
.

Mr.
Noriega
might
have
fallen
of
his
own
weight
in
1988
because
of
Panama
's
dire
economic
situation
,
says
Mr.
Moss
,
but
increasing
external
pressure
has
only
given
him
additional
excuses
for
repression
,
and
a
scapegoat
for
his
own
mismanagement
.

``
If
the
U.S.
had
sat
back
and
done
nothing
,
he
might
not
have
made
it
through
1988
,
''
Mr.
Moss
contends
.

Perhaps
most
important
,
Mr.
Noriega
's
allies
have
intervened
to
encourage
--
in
some
cases
,
to
demand
--
that
the
dictator
maintain
his
grip
of
the
throne
.

One
Colombian
drug
boss
,
upon
hearing
in
1987
that
Gen.
Noriega
was
negotiating
with
the
U.S.
to
abandon
his
command
for
a
comfortable
exile
,
sent
him
a
hand-sized
mahogany
coffin
engraved
with
his
name
.

``
He
is
cornered
,
''
says
the
Rev.
Fernando
Guardia
,
who
has
led
Catholic
Church
opposition
against
Noriega
.

``
The
Americans
have
left
him
without
a
way
out
.

It
is
easy
to
fight
when
you
do
n't
have
any
other
option
.
''

His
chief
advantage
in
the
fight
:
his
intimate
knowledge
of
American
ways
and
weaknesses
.

Mr.
Noriega
often
tells
friends
that
patience
is
the
best
weapon
against
the
gringos
,
who
have
a
short
attention
span
and
little
stomach
for
lasting
confrontation
.

The
U.S.
discovered
the
young
Tony
Noriega
in
late
1959
,
when
he
was
in
his
second
year
at
the
Chorrillos
Military
Academy
in
Lima
,
according
to
former
U.S.
intelligence
officials
.

The
contact
occurred
through
Mr.
Noriega
's
half-brother
,
a
Panamanian
diplomat
based
in
Peru
named
Luis
Carlos
Noriega
Hurtado
.

Luis
Carlos
,
knowing
that
helping
the
Americans
could
advance
the
career
of
any
Panamanian
officer
,
relayed
Tony
's
reports
on
the
leftist
tendencies
he
observed
among
his
fellow
students
and
,
more
important
,
among
his
officers
and
instructors
.

A
spy
was
born
.

It
was
a
heady
experience
for
the
pockmarked
and
slightly
built
Mr.
Noriega
,
who
was
known
to
his
friends
as
Cara
la
Pina
--
pineapple
face
.

Born
the
illegitimate
son
of
his
father
's
maid
,
he
was
raised
on
the
mean
streets
of
the
central
market
district
of
Panama
City
.

Tony
was
four
years
older
than
most
of
his
fellow
cadets
,
and
gained
admission
to
the
academy
because
his
brother
had
falsified
his
birth
certificate
.

He
considered
himself
intellectually
superior
to
his
Peruvian
peers
,
many
of
whom
were
wayward
sons
sent
by
their
well-off
families
to
the
highly
disciplined
,
French-modeled
academy
as
a
sort
of
reform
school
.

In
his
peaked
military
cap
and
neatly
pressed
,
French-made
uniform
,
Noriega
felt
more
respected
and
powerful
than
ever
in
his
underprivileged
life
,
friends
from
the
period
say
.

``
He
had
an
elegant
uniform
with
gold
buttons
in
a
country
where
there
was
a
cult
of
militarism
,
where
officers
were
the
elite
with
special
privileges
,
''
recalls
Darien
Ayala
,
a
fellow
student
in
Peru
and
a
lifelong
friend
.

Mr.
Noriega
's
relationship
to
American
intelligence
agencies
became
contractual
in
either
1966
or
1967
,
intelligence
officials
say
.

His
commanding
officer
at
the
Chiriqui
Province
garrison
,
Major
Omar
Torrijos
,
gave
him
an
intriguing
assignment
:
Mr.
Noriega
would
organize
the
province
's
first
intelligence
service
.

The
spy
network
would
serve
two
clients
:
the
Panamanian
government
,
by
monitoring
political
opponents
in
the
region
,
and
the
U.S.
,
by
tracking
the
growing
Communist
influence
in
the
unions
organized
at
United
Fruit
Co.
's
banana
plantations
in
Bocas
del
Toros
and
Puerto
Armuelles
.

United
Fruit
was
one
of
the
two
largest
contributors
to
Panama
's
national
income
.

Satisfying
its
interests
was
a
priority
for
any
Panamanian
leader
.

Mr.
Noriega
's
initial
retainer
was
only
$
50
to
$
100
a
month
,
plus
occasional
gifts
of
liquor
or
groceries
from
the
American
PX
,
a
former
intelligence
official
says
.

It
was
modest
pay
by
American
standards
,
but
a
healthy
boost
to
his
small
military
salary
,
which
fellow
officers
remember
as
having
been
$
300
to
$
400
monthly
.

``
He
did
it
very
well
,
''
recalls
Boris
Martinez
,
a
former
Panamanian
colonel
who
managed
Mr.
Noriega
and
his
operation
.

``
He
started
building
the
files
that
helped
him
gain
power
.
''

A
National
Guard
job
assumed
by
Capt.
Noriega
in
1964
--
as
chief
of
the
transit
police
in
David
City
,
capital
of
the
Chiriqui
Province
--
was
tailor-made
for
an
aspiring
super-spy
.

By
pressuring
taxi
and
bus
drivers
who
needed
licenses
,
he
gained
a
ready
cache
of
information
.

He
knew
which
local
luminaries
had
been
caught
driving
drunk
,
which
had
been
found
with
their
mistresses
.

This
proved
particularly
valuable
to
the
Panamanian
government
in
1967
,
when
union
leaders
were
planning
a
May
Day
march
that
the
government
feared
could
turn
violent
.

Mr.
Noriega
had
learned
that
a
local
union
leader
was
sleeping
with
the
wife
of
his
deputy
.

So
he
splashed
the
information
on
handbills
that
he
distributed
throughout
the
banana-exporting
city
of
Puerto
Armuelles
,
which
was
ruled
by
United
Fruit
Co
.

The
campaign
so
divided
union
leaders
that
the
government
found
them
far
easier
to
control
.

``
It
was
like
a
play
on
Broadway
,
''
recalls
Mr.
Martinez
.

``
Noriega
managed
the
whole
thing
.

He
was
superb
.

Noriega
was
an
expert
at
bribing
and
blackmailing
people
.
''

During
his
years
in
Chiriqui
,
however
,
Mr.
Noriega
also
revealed
himself
as
an
officer
as
perverse
as
he
was
ingenious
.

Rodrigo
Miranda
,
a
local
lawyer
and
human-rights
monitor
,
recalls
an
intoxicated
Noriega
visiting
prisoners
in
their
cells
at
the
5th
Zone
Garrison
headquarters
in
David
,
where
he
had
his
offices
.

Mr.
Noriega
would
order
them
all
to
take
off
their
clothes
and
run
around
the
courtyard
naked
,
laughing
at
them
and
then
retreating
to
his
office
.

``
People
started
wondering
if
something
was
wrong
with
him
,
''
Mr.
Miranda
recalls
.

But
through
this
period
,
so
far
as
the
U.S.
military
was
concerned
,
Mr.
Noriega
was
a
model
recruit
.

He
signed
up
for
intelligence
and
counter-intelligence
training
under
American
officers
at
Fort
Gulick
in
Panama
in
July
1967
,
according
to
a
copy
of
a
1983
resume
with
details
Mr.
Noriega
has
since
classified
as
secret
.

He
flew
to
Fort
Bragg
,
N.C.
,
in
September
of
that
year
for
a
course
in
psychological
operations
,
returning
to
the
School
of
the
Americas
in
Panama
for
a
two-month
course
called
``
military
intelligence
for
officers
.
''

Some
American
officers
interpreted
his
eagerness
and
studiousness
as
a
sign
of
loyalty
,
but
they
did
so
falsely
.

He
rose
to
chief
of
intelligence
in
Panama
's
socalled
G-2
in
1970
after
providing
populist
dictator
Torrijos
the
critical
support
to
defeat
a
coup
attempt
against
him
a
year
earlier
.

He
became
Gen.
Torrijos
's
inseparable
shadow
,
and
the
holder
of
all
Panama
's
secrets
.

Mr.
Noriega
,
by
now
a
lieutenant
colonel
,
expanded
his
contacts
to
include
the
Cubans
--
not
to
mention
the
Israelis
,
the
Taiwanese
and
any
other
intelligence
service
that
came
knocking
.

When
U.S.
diplomats
complained
to
the
CIA
of
Col.
Noriega
's
moonlighting
,
intelligence
experts
always
insisted
that
his
allegiance
was
first
to
the
Americans
.

``
Early
on
in
the
State
Department
,
we
took
to
calling
him
the
rent-a-colonel
,
in
tribute
to
his
ability
to
simultaneously
milk
the
antagonistic
intelligence
services
of
Cuba
and
the
United
States
,
''
recalls
Francis
J.
McNeil
,
who
,
as
deputy
assistant
secretary
of
state
for
inter-American
affairs
,
first
ran
across
reports
about
Mr.
Noriega
in
1977
.

``
Some
of
us
wondered
how
our
intelligence
people
could
put
so
much
stock
in
his
information
when
he
was
just
as
close
to
the
Cubans
.
''

Even
at
this
early
stage
,
drugs
caused
additional
concerns
.

During
the
Nixon
administration
,
the
Drug
Enforcement
Administration
became
dismayed
at
the
extent
of
the
G-2
's
connections
to
arrested
drug
traffickers
.

One
DEA
agent
drew
up
a
list
of
five
options
for
dealing
with
Col.
Noriega
,
one
of
which
was
assassination
.

The
head
of
the
DEA
at
the
time
,
John
Ingersoll
,
scotched
the
assassination
plan
.

But
he
did
fly
to
Panama
to
scold
dictator
Torrijos
on
the
drug
ties
of
Panamanian
officials
,
including
Mr.
Noriega
.

Mr.
Ingersoll
later
recalled
that
Gen.
Torrijos
seemed
afraid
to
act
on
the
concerns
of
the
U.S.
.

``
Everybody
was
afraid
of
him
,
''
Mr.
Ingersoll
says
.

Mr.
Noriega
became
an
even
greater
threat
in
1976
,
when
U.S.
intelligence
services
discovered
that
he
had
been
buying
recordings
of
electronically
monitored
conversations
from
three
sergeants
working
for
the
U.S.
Army
's
470th
Military
Intelligence
Group
.

The
tapes
included
wiretaps
of
Gen.
Torrijos
's
own
phone
,
according
to
American
intelligence
officials
.

``
We
caught
him
with
his
hands
on
our
cookie
jar
,
''
says
former
CIA
Director
Stansfield
Turner
.

For
the
first
time
,
the
U.S.
considered
cutting
Mr.
Noriega
from
its
intelligence
payroll
--
and
the
deliberations
were
intense
,
Mr.
Turner
says
.

``
In
the
world
of
intelligence
,
if
you
want
to
get
information
,
you
get
it
from
seedy
characters
.

The
question
is
how
much
you
get
tied
in
with
seedy
characters
so
they
can
extort
you
.
''

Intelligence
officials
to
this
day
worry
whether
Mr.
Noriega
sold
sensitive
information
on
the
recordings
to
the
Cubans
or
others
.

Mr.
Turner
was
troubled
enough
to
cancel
the
U.S.
contract
with
the
rent-a-colonel
at
the
beginning
of
the
Carter
administration
.

The
U.S.
soon
found
new
cause
for
concern
:
gun-running
.

Prosecutors
in
Southern
Florida
indicted
five
Panamanians
on
charges
of
illegally
running
arms
to
Sandinista
rebels
trying
to
overthrow
the
Nicaraguan
government
of
Mr.
Somoza
.

They
included
one
of
Mr.
Noriega
's
closest
friends
and
business
partners
,
Carlos
Wittgreen
.

And
the
investigators
were
quickly
closing
in
on
Mr.
Noriega
himself
.

At
the
time
,
though
,
in
1979
,
the
U.S.
was
once
again
flirting
with
its
longtime
Latin
American
spy
.

Mr.
Noriega
made
plans
to
fly
to
Washington
for
a
meeting
with
his
counterpart
at
the
Pentagon
.

Dade
County
and
federal
authorities
,
learning
that
he
intended
to
fly
through
Miami
,
made
plans
to
arrest
him
on
the
gun-running
charges
as
soon
as
he
hit
U.S.
soil
.

It
was
a
Friday
in
June
.

The
Pentagon
foiled
the
plan
.

According
to
military
officers
at
the
time
,
word
was
passed
to
Mr.
Noriega
by
his
American
hosts
that
the
police
would
be
waiting
.

On
Monday
,
U.S.
officials
received
a
routine
,
unclassified
message
from
the
military
group
commander
in
Panama
.

``
Due
to
health
reasons
,
Lt.
Col.
Noriega
has
elected
to
postpone
his
visit
to
Washington
,
''
it
read
.

Prosecutors
in
Miami
received
yet
another
setback
.

Their
original
indictment
against
Mr.
Wittgreen
,
the
friend
of
Mr.
Noriega
,
and
the
other
four
was
dismissed
on
a
technicality
.

But
now
,
along
with
reindicting
Mr.
Noriega
's
pal
,
they
intended
to
charge
Mr.
Noriega
himself
,
on
allegations
that
he
was
involved
in
the
illegal
trading
of
some
$
2
million
in
arms
.

In
January
1980
,
Jerome
Sanford
,
as
assistant
U.S.
attorney
,
was
summoned
to
a
meeting
with
a
Federal
Bureau
of
Investigation
agent
assigned
to
the
Bureau
of
Alcohol
,
Tobacco
and
Firearms
in
Miami
.

Panamanian
dictator
Torrijos
,
he
was
told
,
had
granted
the
shah
of
Iran
asylum
in
Panama
as
a
favor
to
Washington
.

Mr.
Sanford
was
told
Mr.
Noriega
's
friend
,
Mr.
Wittgreen
,
would
be
handling
the
shah
's
security
.

It
would
n't
be
a
good
idea
to
indict
him
--
much
less
Mr.
Noriega
,
the
prosecutor
was
told
.

After
prodding
from
Mr.
Sanford
,
U.S.
Attorney
Jack
Eskenazi
pleaded
with
Justice
Department
officials
in
Washington
to
let
the
indictment
proceed
.

``
Unfortunately
,
''
Mr.
Eskenazi
wrote
in
a
letter
,
``
those
of
us
in
law
enforcement
in
Miami
find
ourselves
frequently
attempting
to
enforce
the
laws
of
the
United
States
but
simultaneously
being
caught
between
foreign
policy
considerations
over
which
we
have
no
control
.
''

The
letter
,
along
with
a
detailed
prosecution
memo
,
sat
on
the
desks
of
Justice
officials
for
months
before
the
case
died
a
quiet
death
.

``
I
think
if
we
had
been
allowed
to
go
ahead
then
we
would
n't
have
the
problems
we
have
now
,
''
Mr.
Sanford
says
.

``
If
he
had
been
found
guilty
,
we
could
have
stopped
him
.
''

In
August
1983
,
Mr.
Noriega
took
over
as
General
and
de-facto
dictator
of
Panama
,
having
maneuvered
his
way
to
the
top
only
two
years
after
the
mysterious
death
in
a
plane
crash
of
his
old
boss
Omar
Torrijos
.

Soon
,
the
military
became
a
veritable
mafia
controlling
legal
and
illegal
businesses
.

The
Reagan
administration
also
put
Mr.
Noriega
's
G-2
back
on
the
U.S.
payroll
.

Payments
averaged
nearly
$
200,000
a
year
from
the
U.S.
Defense
Intelligence
Agency
and
the
CIA
.

Although
working
for
U.S.
intelligence
,
Mr.
Noriega
was
hardly
helping
the
U.S.
exclusively
.

During
the
Reagan
years
he
expanded
his
business
and
intelligence
contacts
with
the
Cubans
and
the
Sandinistas
.

He
allegedly
entered
into
Panama
's
first
formal
business
arrangement
with
Colombian
drug
bosses
,
according
to
Floyd
Carlton
,
a
pilot
who
once
worked
for
Mr.
Noriega
and
who
testified
before
the
U.S.
grand
jury
in
Miami
that
would
ultimately
indict
the
Panamanian
on
drug
charges
.

But
Mr.
Noriega
was
convinced
the
Reagan
White
House
would
n't
act
against
him
,
recalls
his
close
ally
Jose
Blandon
,
because
he
had
an
insurance
policy
:
his
involvement
with
the
Contra
rebels
in
Nicaragua
.

Mr.
Blandon
says
the
general
allowed
the
Contras
to
set
up
a
secret
training
center
in
Panama
.

Mr.
Noriega
also
conveyed
intelligence
from
his
spy
operation
inside
the
Nicaraguan
capital
of
Managua
.

And
on
at
least
one
occasion
,
in
the
spring
of
1985
,
he
helped
arrange
a
sabotage
attack
on
a
Sandinista
arsenal
in
Nicaragua
.

Although
,
his
help
for
the
Contra
cause
was
limited
,
it
was
enough
to
win
him
important
protectors
in
the
Reagan
administration
,
says
Sen.
Patrick
Leahy
,
a
Vermont
Democrat
who
then
served
on
the
Senate
Intelligence
Committee
.

``
Noriega
played
U.S.
intelligence
agencies
and
the
U.S.
government
like
a
violin
,
''
he
says
.

An
incident
in
1984
suggested
one
additional
means
by
which
Mr.
Noriega
might
have
maintained
such
influence
with
Washington
--
by
compromising
U.S.
officials
.

Curtin
Windsor
,
then
the
ambassador
to
Costa
Rica
,
recalls
being
invited
to
Panama
by
Mr.
Noriega
's
brother
Luis
Carlos
for
a
weekend
of
deep
sea
fishing
and
``
quiet
,
serious
conversation
''
on
the
Aswara
Peninsula
.

Mr.
Windsor
notified
Everett
E.
Briggs
,
the
U.S.
ambassador
to
Panama
,
of
the
invitation
.

``
Briggs
screamed
,
''
Mr.
Windsor
recalls
.

He
says
Mr.
Briggs
told
him
he
was
being
set
up
for
a
``
honey
trap
,
''
in
which
Mr.
Noriega
would
try
to
involve
him
in
an
orgy
and
then
record
the
event
``
with
sound
and
video
.
''

Mr.
Briggs
,
on
vacation
after
resigning
his
position
at
the
National
Security
Council
,
could
n't
be
reached
for
comment
.

As
Mr.
Noriega
's
political
troubles
grew
,
so
did
his
offers
of
assistance
to
the
Contras
,
an
apparent
attempt
to
curry
more
favor
in
Washington
.

For
instance
,
he
helped
steal
the
May
1984
Panamanian
elections
for
the
ruling
party
.

But
just
one
month
later
,
he
also
contributed
$
100,000
to
a
Contra
leader
,
according
to
documents
released
for
Oliver
North
's
criminal
trial
in
Washington
,
D.C
.

Yet
,
his
political
setbacks
mounted
.

Mr.
Noriega
was
accused
of
ordering
in
1985
the
beheading
of
Hugo
Spadafora
,
his
most
outspoken
political
opponent
and
the
first
man
to
publicly
finger
Mr.
Noriega
on
drug
trafficking
charges
.

He
then
ousted
President
Nicholas
Ardito
Barletta
,
a
former
World
Bank
official
with
close
ties
to
the
U.S.
,
after
Mr.
Barletta
tried
to
create
a
commission
to
investigate
the
murder
.

And
,
all
the
while
,
Panama
's
debt
problems
continued
to
grow
.

Mr.
Noriega
was
growing
desperate
.

In
late
1986
,
he
made
an
offer
he
thought
the
U.S.
could
n't
refuse
.

As
recounted
in
a
stipulation
that
summarized
government
documents
released
for
the
North
trial
,
Mr.
Noriega
offered
to
assassinate
the
Sandinista
leadership
in
exchange
``
for
a
promise
to
help
clean
up
Noriega
's
image
and
a
commitment
to
lift
the
{
U.S.
.
}
ban
on
military
sales
to
the
Panamanian
Defense
Forces
.
''

``
North
,
''
the
document
went
on
,
referring
to
Oliver
North
,
``
has
told
Noriega
's
representative
that
U.S.
law
forbade
such
actions
.

The
representative
responded
that
Noriega
had
numerous
assets
in
place
in
Nicaragua
and
could
accomplish
many
essential
things
,
just
as
Noriega
had
helped
{
the
U.S.
.
}
the
previous
year
in
blowing
up
a
Sandinista
arsenal
.
''

Col.
North
conveyed
the
request
to
his
superiors
and
to
Assistant
Secretary
of
State
Elliot
Abrams
,
who
relayed
it
to
Secretary
of
State
George
Shultz
.

Mr.
Noriega
's
proposal
was
turned
down
.

And
Mr.
Shultz
curtly
told
Mr.
Abrams
that
the
general
should
be
told
that
only
he
could
repair
his
tarnished
image
.

The
end
of
the
marriage
was
at
hand
.

Within
weeks
the
unfolding
Iran-Contra
scandal
took
away
Mr.
Noriega
's
insurance
policy
.

The
death
of
CIA
Director
William
Casey
and
resignation
of
Oliver
North
allowed
anti-Noriega
political
forces
to
gain
influence
.

Public
protests
against
him
were
triggered
in
June
1987
due
to
charges
by
Diaz
Herrera
,
his
former
chief
of
staff
,
that
Mr.
Noriega
had
stolen
the
1984
election
and
had
ordered
the
killing
of
Messrs.
Spadafora
and
Torrijos
.

Few
American
officials
were
willing
any
longer
to
defend
him
.

Lawyers
in
Miami
--
this
time
working
virtually
without
impediment
--
prepared
to
have
him
indicted
on
drug
charges
in
February
1988
.

During
negotiations
with
American
officials
in
May
1988
over
proposals
to
drop
the
U.S.
indictments
in
exchange
for
his
resignation
,
Mr.
Noriega
often
asked
almost
plaintively
how
the
Americans
,
whom
he
had
helped
for
so
many
years
,
could
turn
against
him
.

Now
,
neither
side
--
the
U.S.
nor
Mr.
Noriega
--
has
an
easy
out
.

President
Bush
has
sworn
to
bring
him
to
justice
.

Mr.
Noriega
believes
he
has
n't
any
alternative
but
to
continue
clutching
to
power
.

It
is
a
knock-out
battle
--
perhaps
to
the
death
.

In
the
end
,
is
Mr.
Noriega
the
political
equivalent
of
Frankenstein
's
monster
,
created
by
a
well-intentioned
but
misguided
foreign
power
?

Not
quite
,
Sen.
Leahy
contends
.

``
For
short-term
gains
,
people
were
willing
to
put
up
with
him
.

That
allowed
him
to
get
stronger
and
stronger
,
''
he
says
.

``
I
do
n't
think
we
created
him
as
much
as
we
fed
him
,
nurtured
him
and
let
him
grow
up
to
be
big
and
strong
.

UPJOHN
Co.
reported
that
third-quarter
net
income
rose
to
$
96
million
,
or
52
cents
a
share
,
from
$
89.6
million
,
or
49
cents
a
share
,
a
year
earlier
.

Yesterday
's
edition
provided
analysts
'
estimates
for
the
company
when
actual
earnings
were
available
.

Industrial
production
declined
0.1
%
in
September
,
reinforcing
other
signs
that
the
manufacturing
sector
continues
its
slowing
trend
.

The
Federal
Reserve
Board
said
output
of
the
nation
's
factories
,
mines
and
utilities
expanded
at
an
annual
rate
of
1.3
%
in
the
third
quarter
,
substantially
slower
than
the
3.3
%
annual
rate
in
the
second
quarter
.

``
Capital
spending
and
exports
,
which
have
been
the
driving
force
in
this
expansion
,
are
showing
clear
signs
of
having
the
steam
taken
out
of
them
,
''
said
Robert
Dederick
,
economist
for
Northern
Trust
Co.
in
Chicago
.

The
new
reports
of
sluggishness
,
which
were
foreshadowed
by
an
earlier
Labor
Department
report
that
manufacturing
payrolls
dropped
by
105,000
in
September
,
give
the
Fed
another
reason
to
further
ease
its
grip
on
credit
and
lower
interest
rates
.

``
They
need
to
do
something
about
this
,

said
Maury
Harris
,
economist
at
PaineWebber
Group
Inc
.

The
Fed
also
said
U.S.
industry
operated
at
83.6
%
of
capacity
last
month
,
down
from
83.8
%
in
August
.

Measures
of
manufacturing
activity
fell
more
than
the
overall
measures
.

Factory
output
dropped
0.2
%
,
its
first
decline
since
February
,
after
having
been
unchanged
in
October
.

Factories
operated
at
83.7
%
of
capacity
,
the
lowest
rate
in
more
than
a
year
and
down
from
84.1
%
in
September
.

The
declines
mainly
reflected
widespread
weakness
in
durable
goods
,
those
intended
to
last
more
than
three
years
.

The
biggest
drop
was
recorded
by
primary
metals
producers
,
a
category
that
includes
the
steel
industry
.

Output
of
business
equipment
was
unchanged
in
September
.

Production
of
factory
equipment
,
one
indication
of
the
strength
of
manufacturers
'
investment
spending
,
fell
0.3
%
.

Some
economists
expect
further
declines
in
investment
spending
.

``
Whenever
corporate
profits
are
weak
that
means
capital
spending
is
going
to
soften
subsequently
,
''
Mr.
Harris
said
.

``
You
have
n't
seen
the
full
effect
of
that
yet
.
''

A
decline
in
truck
production
more
than
offset
a
sharp
rise
in
auto
assemblies
,
the
Fed
noted
.

Analysts
do
n't
expect
the
September
surge
in
auto
production
to
be
repeated
in
the
coming
months
.

Here
is
a
summary
of
the
Federal
Reserve
Board
's
report
on
industrial
production
in

figures
are

Lung-cancer
mortality
rates
for
people
under
45
years
of
age
have
begun
to
decline
,
federal
researchers
report
.

The
drop
is
particularly
large
for
white
males
,
although
black
males
and
white
and
black
women
also
show
lower
mortality
rates
.

A
report
in
this
week
's
issue
of
the
Journal
of
the
National
Cancer
Institute
also
projects
that
overall
U.S.
mortality
rates
from
lung
cancer
,
the
leading
cause
of
cancer
death
,
should
begin
to
drop
in
several
years
if
cigarette
smoking
continues
to
abate
.

The
report
,
which
comes
25
years
after
the
U.S.
Surgeon
General
issued
a
report
warning
against
the
dangers
of
smoking
,
is
the
strongest
indication
to
date
that
the
reduction
in
smoking
is
leading
to
lower
death
rates
from
lung
cancer
.

``
What
this
is
saying
is
that
the
surgeon
general
's
message
is
having
an
impact
,
''
said
Melvyn
Tockman
,
an
epidemiologist
at
the
Johns
Hopkins
School
of
Hygiene
and
Public
Health
in
Baltimore
.

The
National
Cancer
Institute
report
compares
mortality
rates
of
two
groups
of
people
between
the
ages
of
35
and
44
a
decade
apart
.

The
death
rate
from
lung
cancer
of
white
males
aged
35
to
44
in
the
mid-1970s
was
13.4
per
100,000
,
but
the
mortality
rate
of
the
same
age
group
in
the
mid-1980s
was
9.6
,
a
decline
of
28.7
%
.

Measured
the
same
way
,
the
decline
for
black
males
was
14.2
%
.

The
drop
in
mortality
rates
for
women
was
less
steep
--
8.9
%
for
blacks
and
5.3
%
for
whites
.

The
study
,
by
Susan
Devesa
,
William
Blot
and
Joseph
Fraumeni
of
the
institute
's
staff
,
also
shows
that
the
incidence
of
lung
cancer
as
well
as
the
death
rate
declined
over
the
decade
for
all
groups
in
the
35-44
age
bracket
,
except
black
men
.

Although
lung-cancer
mortality
rates
are
increasing
for
the
nation
as
a
whole
,
the
report
projects
that
death
rates
will
begin
to
decline
in
the
1990s
for
men
and
after
the
year
2000
for
women
.

Lung-cancer
mortality
rates
increase
with
age
and
are
continuing
to
rise
for
all
age
groups
over
55
,
with
sharp
increases
for
everybody
but
white
men
.

But
Dr.
Fraumeni
,
one
of
the
authors
of
the
report
,
said
``
the
declining
rates
we
're
seeing
for
younger
people
we
believe
may
be
a
harbinger
of
declining
mortality
in
the
future
.
''

However
,
he
stressed
that
the
improvement
depends
on
a
continued
reduction
in
smoking
.

``
Even
though
these
favorable
trends
in
lung-cancer
mortality
affect
all
sex
and
race
groups
,
they
ca
n't
be
taken
for
granted
,
''
the
report
says
.

``
Smoking
prevention
programs
should
reach
larger
segments
of
the
population
,
especially
children
,
adolescents
and
minorities
.
''

An
editorial
in
the
NCI
Journal
says
the
report
of
declining
lung-cancer
mortality
``
among
young
men
and
women
in
the
U.S.
indicates
that
we
finally
may
be
winning
the
battle
--
this
even
in
a
country
where
the
tobacco
industry
spends
over
$
2
billion
a
year
for
promotion
of
the
addictive
habit
of
smoking
.
''

But
the
editorial
,
by
Jan
Stjernsward
of
the
World
Health
Organization
,
notes
that
tobacco
consumption
and
lung-cancer
mortality
rates
are
rising
in
developing
countries
.

``
Non-smoking
should
be
established
as
the
norm
of
social
behavior
''
around
the
world
,
the
editorial
says
,
through
the
enactment
of
laws
that
limit
advertising
,
boost
tobacco
prices
and
promote
anti-smoking
education
.

Asked
for
comment
,
Walker
Merryman
,
a
vice
president
of
the
Tobacco
Institute
,
said
new
efforts
to
restrict
tobacco
advertising
in
the
U.S.
could
violate
the
First
Amendment
protection
of
free
speech
.

According
to
the
American
Cancer
Society
,
smoking
is
responsible
for
85
%
of
the
lung-cancer
cases
among
men
and
75
%
among
women
.

The
NCI
report
attributes
the
differences
in
mortality
rates
by
race
to
different
smoking
patterns
.

A
higher
proportion
of
black
men
smoke
than
white
men
.

While
nearly
equal
percentages
of
black
and
white
women
currently
smoke
,
in
both
sexes
more
whites
have
given
up
smoking
than
blacks
.

In
comparing
changes
in
mortality
rates
over
the
past
decade
,
the
NCI
study
looked
only
at
blacks
and
whites
.

Asians
and
native
Americans
were
n't
studied
;
Hispanics
were
included
with
whites

Traders
trying
to
profit
from
the
recent
volatility
in
financial
markets
invaded
the
Nasdaq
over-the-counter
market
,
prompting
even
more
swings
in
stock
prices
.

After
gaining
strength
during
a
brief
run-up
when
trading
began
,
the
Nasdaq
Composite
Index
weakened
under
selling
pressure
.

The
forces
at
work
included
computer-guided
trading
,
as
well
as
profit-driven
market
makers
and
institutional
investors
who
had
bought
stock
on
the
cheap
during
the
recent
correction
.

During
the
last
two
hours
of
trading
,
the
composite
almost
drew
even
on
the
day
before
slipping
again
.

The
Nasdaq
Composite
closed
down
1.05
,
or
0.2
%
,
to
459.93
.

The
action
was
confined
to
Nasdaq
's
biggest
and
most
liquid
stocks
,
traders
said
.

The
Nasdaq
100
Index
began
the
day
at
449.89
,
lost
2
%
at
one
point
,
and
was
up
0.4
%
at
another
.

The
barometer
of
the
biggest
nonfinancial
stocks
settled
at
448.49
,
off
1.40
.

Its
counterpart
,
the
Nasdaq
Financial
Index
,
was
weak
for
most
of
the
day
,
sliding
2.51
to
453.57
by
the
end
of
trading
.

The
volatility
was
dizzying
for
traders
.

``
The
market
must
have
turned
up
and
down
15
different
times
,
''
commented
Lance
Zipper
,
head
of
OTC
trading
at
Kidder
Peabody
.

``
Every
time
you
thought
it
was
going
into
a
rally
it
gave
up
,
and
every
time
you
thought
it
would
rally
it
came
down
.

This
is
a
tough
market
.
''

Mr.
Zipper
said
the
market
is
still
settling
down
after
the
recent
correction
.

Most
of
trading
action
now
is
from
professional
traders
who
are
trying
to
take
advantage
of
the
price
swings
to
turn
a
quick
profit
,
he
and
other
traders
said
.

``
Everybody
's
confused
and
no
one
has
an
opinion
that
lasts
longer
than
30
seconds
,
''
said
Mr.
Zipper
.

``
A
lot
of
the
professional
traders
are
just
going
back
and
forth
.

They
're
just
as
confused

William
Rothe
,
head
of
OTC
trading
at
Alex
.
Brown
&
Sons
,
in
Baltimore
,
said
program
trading
is
keeping
the
markets
unsettled
.

He
believes
that
the
volatile
conditions
created
by
program
trading
has
``
thoroughly
confused
''
investors
about
where
the
market
is
headed
.

Program
trading
is
``
benefiting
a
few
to
the
detriment
of
many
and
I
wish
someone
would
do
something
about
it
,
''
he
complained
.

Trading
activity
cooled
off
from
Monday
's
sizzling
pace
.

Share

subsided
to

for

In
a
statement
,

with

centers
on
questions
of
the
usability
of
certain
batches
of
EPO
material
valued
at
$
13.6
million
.

Earlier
this

The

also
pleased
analysts
by
announcing
four
new
store
openings
planned

That

bring

Certainly
conservative
environmentalists
can
defend
their
limited
government
position
by
differentiating
between
Old
Environmentalism
and
New
Environmentalism
(
``
Journalists
and
Others
for
Saving
the
Planet
,
''
by
David
Brooks
,
editorial
page
,
Oct.

)
.

Old
Environmentalism
involved
microbe
hunters
and
sanitationists
.

It
started
with
improvements
in
hygiene
made
possible
by
affordable
soap
and
washable
underwear
during
the
Industrial
Revolution
.

Then
cast-iron
sewer
pipe
and
the
flush
toilet
were
followed
by
sewage
-
and
water-treatment
plants
toward
the
end
of
the
19th
century
.

Medicine
in
the
19th
century
was
dedicated
mostly
to
combating
sepsis
and
diagnostic
analysis
.

Then
the
20th
century
saw
the
evolution
of
private-sector
wonder
drugs
,
which
promulgated
medical
therapy
.

The
process
dramatically
increased
our
average
life
expectancy
,
eliminated
much
pain
and
constantly
improved
health
and
well-being
.

Most
public-health
measures
were
handled
at
the
local
level
.

New
Environmentalism
probably
started
in
1962
with
the
publication
of
Rachel
Carson
's
book
``
Silent
Spring
.
''

Shortly
thereafter
,
hysterical
articles
began
to
appear
predicting
that
advanced
industrial
societies
would
produce
a
blackened
,
uninhabitable
planet
possibly
by
the
turn
of
the
century
.

These
apocalyptic
predictions
were
advanced
by
such
stalwarts
as
Paul
Ehrlich
,
Barry
Commoner
,
Rene
Dubois
and
George
Wald
.

Writing
in
the
1960s
Ms.
Carson
suggested
that
the
human
race
could
be
eliminated
in
20
years
,
and
Mr.
Wald
suggested
that
life
on
earth
might
end
by
1985
.

Mr.
Ehrlich
predicted
unprecedented
famine
by
1980
.

There
were
many
more
.

Thousands
of
chemical
products
were
categorized
as
carcinogenic
,
with
recommendations
that
they
be
banned
from
industrial
use
because
they
produced
malignant
tumors
in
overdosed
rats
.

Unknown
before
1960
were
the
inconclusive
effects
of
acid
rain
,
greenhouse
warming
and
ozone
depletion
,
all
of
which
required
burgeoning
political
power
and
gargantuan
expense
.

Meanwhile
,
the
New
Environmentalists
systematically
opposed
the
methods
of
the
Old
Environmentalists
.

Local
pollution
problems
require
cheap
energy
and
capital
for
their
solution
.

But
the
New
Environmentalists
oppose
private
wealth
creation
(
which
,
they
claim
,
depletes
natural
resources
)
and
nuclear
power
(
even
though
it
would
counteract
the
greenhouse
effect
)
.

They
are
in
the
forefront
of
opposing
the
search
for
new
landfills
and
methods
of
incineration
and
even
oppose
new
methods
of
research
such
as
genetic
engineering
.

New
Environmentalism
is
an
emotional
attack
on
proven
methods
of
improving
our
quality
of
life
and
a
bid
for
political
power
.

Let
's
rationalize
our
priorities
by
solving
pollution
problems
at
the
local
level
as
heretofore
.

Harry
Lee
Smith

Your
story
missed
some
essential
points
of
the
conference
on
``
The
Global
Environment
:
Are
We
Overreacting
?
''

First
and
foremost
,
the
vignettes
presented
by
the
various
scientists
represent
a
general
consensus
among
specialists
working
in
the
respective
aspects
of
the
global
environment
.

Consider
,
for
example
,
the
greenhouse
effect
and
climate
change
;
numerous
blue-ribbon
scientific
committees
,
including
one
from
the
National
Academy
of
Science
,
judge
there
is
a
greater
than
50
%
probability
of
a
grave
problem
in
the
offing
.

The
point
was
to
answer
the
question
in
the
conference
title
,
not
to
try
to
create
news
stories
for
the
event
itself
.

Nor
was
it
intended
to
dictate
a
set
of
prescriptive
solutions
,
although
various
points
were
raised
.

Each
speaker
was
asked
to
address
a
specific
topic
,
not
deliver
a
point
of
view
.

Each
scientist
independently
concluded
society
and
government
are
underreacting
when
it
comes
to
substantive
policy
change
.

This
leads
to
a
very
special
sense
of
urgency
.

If
the
media
decide
to
work
harder
at
educating
the
public
about
these
complex
and
technical
issues
,
that
hardly
can
be
termed
non-objective
journalism
.

The
environment
can
no
longer
be
a
normal
issue
,
to
be
dealt
with
on
a
business-as-usual
basis
with
comfortable
increments
of
change
.

We
have
literally
altered
the
chemistry
and
physics
of
our
planet
's
atmosphere
.

This
portends
consequences
from
what
we
have
already
done
that
will
be
very
destabilizing
to
social
and
economic
systems
.

The
problems
of
the
environment
are
so
interrelated
,
so
inextricably
entwined
with
our
current
way
of
life
and
so
large
that
it
is
unlikely
we
will
be
able
to
address
them
effectively
unless
major
changes
are
made
in
less
than
10
years
.

The
consensus
from
the
scientific
community
is
that
there
is
sufficient
evidence
to
advise
major
policy
changes
.

No
,
we
are
not
overreacting
.

Thomas
E.
Lovejoy
Assistant
Secretary
for
External
Affairs
Smithsonian
Institution

Coca-Cola
Enterprises
Inc.
,
fulfilling
its
dismal
earnings
forecast
for
1989
,
said
its
third-quarter
net
income
fell
68
%
on
flat
revenue
.

Stung
by
higher
marketing
costs
and
slowing
volume
growth
,
the
giant
Coke
bottling
operation
said
net
fell
to
$
12.7
million
,
or
six
cents
a
share
,
from
$
39.9
million
,
or
26
cents
a
share
,
the
year
earlier
.

The
results
met
estimates
of
analysts
,
who
had
already
slashed
their
projections
after
the
company
said
in
late
August
that
its
1989
earnings
could
tumble
as
much
as
37
%
.

A
company
spokesman
said
yesterday
that
Coca-Cola
Enterprises
sticks
by
its
1989
forecast
.

Third-quarter
revenue
was
flat
at
$
1.02
billion
.

The
year-ago
results
,
however
,
included
the
operations
of
a
bottling
business
,
which
was
sold
last
December
.

Excluding
that
bottling
business
,
Coca-Cola
Enterprises
'
volume
,
measured
by
cases
of
soda
,
rose
only
1
%
.

The
volume
is
well
below
the
industry
's
4
%
to
5
%
growth
rate
of
recent
years
,
but
in
line
with
other
soft-drink
companies
for
the
third
quarter
.

The
latest
third-quarter
volume
also
compares
with
a
very
strong
10
%
growth
in
the
year-ago
quarter
.

Coca-Cola
Enterprises
blamed
the
lower
volume
on
its
soft-drink
prices
,
which
were
about
3
%
higher
in
the
third
quarter
.

Consumers
have
been
accustomed
to
buying
soft-drinks
at
discounted
prices
for
several
years
.

Coca-Cola
Enterprises
said
it
had
to
boost
spending
for
trade
and
dealer
incentives
to
try
to
keep
volumes
from
slipping
.

The
company
said
it
expects
consumers
will
adjust
to
higher-priced
soft
drinks
.

A
spokesman
attributed
the
bulk
of
a
14
%
increase
in
selling
,
administrative
and
general
expenses
--
to
$
324.9
million
--
to
marketing
costs
.

``
They
're
out
there
promoting
like
crazy
,
trying
to
get
prices
up
by
promotion
,
''
said
Roy
Burry
,
an
analyst
with
Kidder
,
Peabody
&
Co
.

For
the
nine
months
,
Coca-Cola
Enterprises
'
net
fell
31
%
to
$
65
million
,
or
39
cents
a
share
,
from
$
93.8
million
,
or
63
cents
a
share
.

Revenue
was
flat
at
about
$
2.97
billion
.

Coca-Cola
Enterprises
,
which
is
49%-owned
by
Coca-Cola
Co.
,
also
said
it
repurchased
about
1.2
million
of
its
common
shares
during
the
third
quarter
.

The
buy-back
is
part
of
a
25-million-share
repurchase
plan
,
under
which
Coca-Cola
Enterprises
so
far
has
acquired
a
total
of
9.7
million
shares
.

Separately
,
Purchase
,
N.Y.-based
PepsiCo
Inc.
,
as
expected
,
said
fiscal
third-quarter
net
rose
11
%
to
$
269.3
million
,
or
$
1.02
a
share
,
from
$
241.6
million
,
or
91
cents
a
share
.

Sales
rose
25
%
to
$
3.90
billion
from
$
3.13
billion
.

The
year-ago
quarter
's
results
include
an
after-tax
charge
of
$
5.9
million
from
the
sale
of
a
winery
in
Spain
.

In

L.J.
Hooker
Corp.
is
expected
to
reach
an
agreement
in
principle
this
week
to
sell
Merksamer
Jewelers
Inc.
to
management
,
say
executives
familiar
with
the
talks
.

L.J.
Hooker
,
based
in
Atlanta
,
filed
for
Chapter
11
bankruptcy
protection
earlier
this
year
.

Currently
,
its
parent
company
,
Hooker
Corp.
of
Sydney
,
Australia
,
is
being
managed
by
a
court-appointed
liquidator
.

It
is
expected
that
GE
Capital
Corp.
,
a
financial-services
subsidiary
of
General
Electric
Co.
,
will
provide
much
of
the
funding
for
the
proposed
leveraged
buy-out
of
Merksamer
,
based
in
Sacramento
,
Calif
.

A
spokesman
for
GE
Capital
declined
to
comment
.

GE
Capital
has
a
working
relationship
with
L.J.
Hooker
.

It
is
providing
$
50
million
in
emergency
financing
to
the
company
and
has
agreed
to
buy
as
much
as
$
75
million
in
receivables
from
B.
Altman
&
Co.
and
Bonwit
Teller
,
L.J.
Hooker
's
two
fully
owned
department-store
chains
.

Sam
Merksamer
,
chief
executive
officer
of
the
nationwide
jewelry
chain
,
and
Sanford
Sigoloff
,
chief
executive
of
L.J.
Hooker
Corp.
,
both
declined
to
comment
.

Currently
,
Mr.
Merksamer
owns
20
%
of
the
company
;
L.J.
Hooker
acquired
its
80
%
interest
in
the
firm
in
May
1986
.

At
the
time
,
the
Merksamer
chain
had
11
stores
in
operation
.

Today
,
there
are
77
units
,
all
located
in
shopping
malls
.

In
recent
weeks
Mr.
Merksamer
has
approached
a
number
of
his
suppliers
and
asked
them
to
provide
letters
of
intent
saying
they
will
continue
shipping
merchandise
to
the
chain
following
the
buy-out
,
say
those
familiar
with
the
situation
.

This
year
,
a
number
of
retail
leveraged
buyouts
have
failed
,
causing
jitters
among
suppliers
,
and
Mr.
Merksamer
apparently
wanted
assurances
that
he
wo
n't
have
delivery
problems
.

For
the
year
ended
June
30
,
1989
,
Merksamer
Jewelers
had
$
62
million
of
revenue
and
operating
profit
of
$
2.5
million
.

The
jewelery
chain
was
put
up
for
sale
in
June
.

According
to
those
familiar
with
the
situation
,
other
bidders
included
Ratners
Group
PLC
of
London
and
Kay
Jewelers
Inc
.

First
Boston
Corp.
is
advising
L.J.
Hooker
on
the
sale
of
the
Merksamer
business
.

Merksamer
was
the
first
in
a
series
of
retail
acquisitions
made
by
L.J.
Hooker
.

The
company
was
founded
in
Sacramento
in
1929
by
two
brothers
,
Ralph
and
Walter
Merksamer
,
who
operated
as
DeVon
's
Jewelers
.

In
1979
,
the
pair
split
the
company
in
half
,
with
Walter
and
his
son
,
Sam
,
agreeing
to
operate
under
the
Merksamer
Jewelery
name
.

The
sale
of
Merksamer
Jewelers
is
subject
to
approval
by
Judge
Tina
Brozman
of
U.S.
Bankruptcy
Court
.

As
earlier
reported
,
L.J.
Hooker
this
week
received
a
$
409
million
bid
for
its
three
shopping
malls
,
plus
other
properties
from
a
consortium
led
by
Honolulu
real-estate
investor
Jay
Shidler
and
A.
Boyd
Simpson
,
an
Atlanta
developer
and
former
L.J.
Hooker
senior
executive
.

The
offer
,
which
did
n't
include
the
Merksamer
chain
,
is
being
reviewed
by
Mr.
Sigoloff
.

Robert
J.
Regal
was
named
president
and
chief
executive
officer
of
this
company
's
Universal-Rundle
Corp.
unit
.

Mr.
Regal
had
been
president
and
chief
executive
of
RBS
Industries
Inc
.

Robert
H.
Carlson
,
previous
president
and
chief
executive
of
Universal-Rundle
,
will
assume
the
title
of
chairman
of
the
unit
,
a
vitreous-china
maker
.

The
days
may
be
numbered
for
animated
shows
featuring
Alf
,
the
Karate
Kid
and
the
Chipmunks
.

NBC
,
a
leader
in
morning
,
prime-time
and
late
night
programs
but
an
also-ran
on
Saturday
mornings
,
when
children
rule
the
TV
set
,
is
contemplating
getting
out
of
the
cartoon
business
.

Instead
,
network
officials
say
,
it
may
``
counterprogram
''
with
shows
for
an
audience
that
is
virtually
ignored
in
that
time
period
:
adults
.

``
There
is
talk
of
some
revamping
and
we
're
certainly
heading
in
the
direction
of
less
and
less
animation
,
''
said
Joseph
S.
Cicero
,
vice
president
of
finance
and
administration
for
National
Broadcasting
Co.
,
a
unit
of
General
Electric
Co
.

Mr.
Cicero
said
that
NBC
Entertainment
president
Brandon
Tartikoff
,
who
declined
to
be
interviewed
,
is
``
looking
at
options
now
and
may
put
some
things
into
the
schedule
by
mid-season
.
''

He
declined
to
elaborate
.

NBC
's
options
could
range
from
news-oriented
programming
to
sports
shows
,
although
the
network
declined
to
comment
.

One
major
NBC
affiliate
,
KCRA
in
Sacramento
,
plans
to
cancel
the
NBC
Saturday
morning
line-up
as
of
January
and
replace
it
with
a
local
newscast
.

The
one-hour
program
will
be
repeated
with
updates
throughout
Saturday
mornings
.

``
We
feel
there
is
an
opportunity
for
an
audience
that
is
not
being
served
by
any
network
,
so
we
want
to
take
the
lead
,
''
says
KCRA
's
general
manager
,
John
Kueneke
.

``
We
do
n't
need
cartoons
anymore
.

They
only
accounted
for
5
%
,
at
best
,
of
the
station
's
total
revenues
.
''

An
NBC
spokesman
says
the
network
will
``
closely
monitor
''
the
Sacramento
situation
,
and
says
it
is
the
only
station
to
defect
.

Spokesmen
for
the
television
networks
of
CBS
Inc.
and
Capital
Cities\/ABC
Inc.
,
say
there
are
no
plans
to
alter
the
children
's
line-up
on
Saturday
mornings
.

The
youthful
audience
for
Saturday
programming
is
no
longer
dependent
on
the
networks
.

There
has
been
a
surge
in
syndicated
children
's
shows
to
independent
stations
,
as
well
as
competition
from
videocassettes
for
kids
and
from
cable
outlets
such
as
Nickelodeon
and
the
Disney
Channel
.

At
the
same
time
,
there
appears
to
be
a
market
for
news-oriented
programming
;
Turner
Broadcasting
System
Inc.
's
Cable
News
Network
has
its
highest
ratings
,
outside
of
prime
time
,
on
Saturday
mornings
.

NBC
has
on
previous
occasions
considered
replacing
cartoons
with
a
Saturday
version
of
``
Today
,
''
which
is
produced
by
NBC
News
.

The
network
's
own
production
company
,
NBC
Productions
,
supplies
a
half-hour
family-oriented
show
titled
``
Saved
By
The
Bell
.
''

NBC
Productions
or
NBC
News
could
supply
the
network
with
other
Saturday
morning
shows
,
a
move
that
would
control
costs
.

Animated
shows
,
which
are
made
by
outside
production
companies
,
cost
the
network
about
$
300,000
per
episode
.

Rohm
&
Haas
Co.
said
third-quarter
net
income
skidded
35
%
to
$
32.6
million
,
or
49
cents
a
share
.

In
the
year-earlier
quarter
,
the
chemicals
company
had
net
of
$
49.8
million
,
or
75
cents
a
share
.

Sales
were
$
623
million
,
up
0.5
%
from
$
619.8
million
a
year
ago
.

Rohm
&
Haas
,
which
plans
to
start
operating
seven
new
production
units
this
year
,
attributed
the
profit
slide
partly
to
higher
start-up
expense
.

The
company
also
cited
the
stronger
dollar
,
which
cuts
the
value
of
overseas
profit
when
it
is
translated
into
dollars
.

In
addition
,
the
company
said
,
it
was
hurt
by
higher
than
previous-year
costs
for
raw
materials
,
though
those
costs
have
declined
since
the
second
quarter
.

Incrementally
higher
production
of
those
chemicals
which
remain
in
heavy
demand
also
has
forced
up
costs
,
such
as
overtime
pay
.

For
the
nine
months
,
Rohm
&
Haas
net
totaled
$
155
million
,
or
$
2.33
a
share
,
down
17
%
from
$
187.8
million
,
or
$
2.82

.

Sales
rose
5.2
%
to
$
2.04

colon
cancer
is
really
getting
short
shrift
if
he
's
not
getting
this
therapy
.
''

I
did
n't
say
this
,
and
I
'm
totally
opposed
to
the
philosophy
expressed
by
the
quote
.

I
have
not
offered
and
will
not
offer
routine
therapy
with
the
two
drugs
,
levamisole
and
5-fluorouracil
,
to
any
of
my
colon-cancer
patients
.

With
this
treatment
we
have
reduced
deaths
in
high-risk
colon
cancer
by
one-third
--
but
this
leaves
the
two-thirds
who
are
dying
of
cancer
.

This
is
not
nearly
good
enough
.

I
believe
any
physician
who
truly
cares
about
cancer
patients
,
both
today
and
tomorrow
,
should
offer
the
hope
of
something
better
than
that
.

My
statement
,
read
verbatim
from
a
printed
text
available
to
all
reporters
attending
the
National
Cancer
Institute
news
conference
,
was
the
following
:
``
New
clinical
trials
are
already
in
operation
seeking
to
improve
these
results
.

These
research
protocols
offer
to
the
patient
not
only
the
very
best
therapy
which
we
have
established
today
but
also
the
hope
of
something
still
better
.

I
feel
any
patient
with
high-risk
cancer
is
getting
short
shrift
if
he
is
not
offered
this
opportunity
.
''

We
have
very
exciting
prospects
for
far
more
impressive
advances
in
the
treatment
of
colon
cancer
during
the
years
immediately
ahead
.

This
hope
,
however
,
will
never
be
realized
if
we
use
levamisole
and
5-fluorouracil
as
a
stopping
point
.

The
oil
and
auto
industries
,
united
in
their
dislike
of
President
Bush
's
proposal
for
cars
that
run
on
alternative
fuels
,
announced
a
joint
research
program
that
could
turn
up
a
cleaner-burning
gasoline
.

Officials
of
the
Big
Three
auto
makers
and
14
petroleum
companies
said
they
are
setting
out
to
find
the
most
cost-effective
fuel
for
reducing
cities
'
air-pollution
problems
,
with
no
bias
toward
any
fuel
in
particular
.

However
,
their
search
notably
wo
n't
include
natural
gas
or
pure
methanol
--
the
two
front-running
alternative
fuels
--
in
tests
to
be
completed
by
next
summer
.

Instead
,
the
tests
will
focus
heavily
on
new
blends
of
gasoline
,
which
are
still
undeveloped
but
which
the
petroleum
industry
has
been
touting
as
a
solution
for
automobile
pollution
that
is
choking
urban
areas
.

Environmentalists
criticized
the
program
as
merely
a
public-relations
attempt
to
head
off
a
White
House
proposal
to
require
a
million
cars
a
year
that
run
on
cleaner-burning
fuels
by
1997
.

While
major
oil
companies
have
been
experimenting
with
cleaner-burning
gasoline
blends
for
years
,
only
Atlantic
Richfield
Co.
is
now
marketing
a
lower-emission
gasoline
for
older
cars
currently
running
on
leaded
fuel
.

The
initial
$
11
million
research
program
will
conduct
the
most
extensive
testing
to
date
of
reformulated
gasolines
,
said
Joe
Colucci
,
head
of
fuels
and
lubricants
at
General
Motors
Corp.
research
laboratories
.

It
will
compare
21
different
blends
of
gasolines
with
three
mixtures
of
up
to
85
%
methanol
.

A
second
phase
of
research
,
which
is
still
being
planned
,
will
test
reformulated
gasolines
on
newer
engine
technologies
now
being
developed
for
use
in
1992
or
1993
cars
.

There
was
no
cost
estimate
for
the
second
phase
.

``
The
whole
idea
here
is
the
automobile
and
oil
companies
have
joint
customers
,
''
said
Keith
McHenry
,
a
senior
vice
president
of
technology
at
Amoco
Corp
.

``
And
we
are
looking
for
the
most
cost-effective
way
to
clean
up
the
air
.
''

But
David
Hawkins
,
an
environmental
lawyer
with
the
Natural
Resources
Defense
Council
,
said
the
research
appears
merely
to
be
a
way
to
promote
reformulated
gasoline
.

Oil
and
auto
companies
supported
a
move
on
Capitol
Hill
last
week
to
gut
Mr.
Bush
's
plans
to
require
auto
makers
to
begin
selling
alternative-fueled
cars
by
1995
.

Instead
,
a
House
subcommittee
adopted
a
clean-fuels
program
that
specifically
mentions
reformulated
gasoline
as
an
alternative
.

The
Bush
administration
has
said
it
will
try
to
resurrect
its
plan
when
the
House
Energy
and
Commerce
Committee
takes
up
a
comprehensive
clean-air
bill
.

William
Seidman
,
chairman
of
the
Federal
Deposit
Insurance
Corp.
,
said
Lincoln
Savings
&
Loan
Association
should
have
been
seized
by
the
government
in
1986
to
contain
losses
that
he
estimated
will
cost
taxpayers
as
much
as
$
2
billion
.

Mr.
Seidman
,
who
has
been
the
nation
's
top
bank
regulator
,
inherited
the
problems
of
Lincoln
,
based
in
Irvine
,
Calif.
,
after
his
regulatory
role
was
expanded
by
the
new
savings-and-loan
bailout
law
.

He
made
his
comments
before
House
Banking
Committee
hearings
to
investigate
what
appears
to
be
the
biggest
thrift
disaster
in
a
scandal-ridden
industry
.

The
inquiry
also
will
cover
the
actions
of
Charles
Keating
Jr.
,
who
is
chairman
of
American
Continental
Corp.
,
Lincoln
's
parent
,
and
who
contributed
heavily
to
several
U.S.
senators
.

Mr.
Seidman
told
the
committee
that
the
Resolution
Trust
Corp.
,
the
agency
created
to
sell
sick
thrifts
,
has
studied
Lincoln
's
examination
reports
by
former
regulators
dating
back
to
1986
.

``
My
staff
indicated
that
had
we
made
such
findings
in
one
of
our
own
institutions
,
we
would
have
sought
an
immediate
cease-and-desist
order
to
stop
the
hazardous
operations
,
''
Mr.
Seidman
said
.

When
Lincoln
was
seized
by
the
government
,
for
example
,
15
%
of
its
loans
,
or
$
250
million
,
were
to
borrowers
who
were
buying
real
estate
from
one
of
American
Continental
's
50
other
subsidiaries
,
according
to
Mr.
Seidman
.

But
the
government
did
n't
step
in
until
six
months
ago
,
when
thrift
officials
put
Lincoln
into
conservatorship
--
the
day
after
American
Continental
filed
for
Chapter
11
bankruptcy
protection
from
creditors
.

The
bankruptcy
filing
,
the
government
has
charged
in
a
$
1.1
billion
civil
lawsuit
,
was
part
of
a
pattern
to
shift
insured
deposits
to
the
parent
company
,
which
used
the
deposits
as
a
cache
for
real-estate
deals
.

The
deposits
that
have
been
transferred
to
other
subsidiaries
are
now
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
bankruptcy
court
.

``
I
think
it
's
fairly
clear
{
Mr.
Keating
}
knew
,
''
that
regulators
were
set
to
seize
Lincoln
,
Mr.
Seidman
said
.

Further
investigation
,
he
said
,
may
result
in
further
actions
against
Lincoln
's
executives
,
said
Mr.
Seidman
,
``
including
fraud
actions
.
''

Mr.
Keating
,
for
his
part
,
has
filed
suit
alleging
that
regulators
unlawfully
seized
the
thrift
.

Leonard
Bickwit
,
an
attorney
in
Washington
for
Mr.
Keating
,
declined
to
comment
on
the
hearings
,
except
to
say
,
``
We
will
be
responding
comprehensively
in
several
forums
to
each
of
these
allegations
at
the
appropriate
time
.
''

Lincoln
's
treatment
by
former
thrift
regulators
,
in
an
agency
disbanded
by
the
new
law
,
has
proved
embarrassing
for
five
senators
who
received
thousands
of
dollars
in
campaign
contributions
from
Mr.
Keating
.

Mr.
Seidman
said
yesterday
,
for
example
,
that
Sen.
Dennis
DeConcini
(
D.
,
Ariz.
)
,
who
received
$
48,100
in
contributions
from
Mr.
Keating
,
phoned
Mr.
Seidman
to
request
that
he
push
for
a
sale
of
Lincoln
before
it
would
be
seized
.

After
the
government
lawsuit
was
filed
against
Lincoln
,
Sen.
DeConcini
returned
the
campaign
contributions
.

The
senator
's
spokesman
said
yesterday
that
he
pushed
for
the
sale
of
Lincoln
because
``
hundreds
of
Arizona
jobs
{
at
Lincoln
}
were
on
the
line
.
''

Senate
Banking
Committee
Chairman
Donald
Riegle
(
D.
,
Mich
.
)
has
also
returned
contributions
he
received
from
Mr.
Keating
a
year
ago
.

Sens.
John
Glenn
(
D.
,
Ohio
)
,
John
McCain
,
(
R.
,
Ariz.
)
and
Alan
Cranston
(
D.
,
Calif.
)
also
received
substantial
contributions
from
Mr.
Keating
and
sought
to
intervene
on
behalf
of
Lincoln
.

House
Banking
Committee
Chairman
Henry
Gonzalez
(
D.
,
Texas
)
said
Sen.
Cranston
volunteered
to
appear
before
the
House
committee
,
if
necessary
.

But
a
committee
staff
member
said
the
panel
is
unlikely
to
pursue
closely
the
role
of
the
senators
.

At
the
hearing
,
Mr.
Seidman
said
the
RTC
has
already
pumped
$
729
million
into
Lincoln
for
liquidity
.

He
also
held
out
little
hope
of
restitution
for
purchasers
of
$
225
million
in
American
Continental
subordinated
debt
.

Some
of
those
debtholders
have
filed
a
suit
,
saying
they
believed
they
were
buying
government-insured
certificates
of
deposit
.

``
We
have
no
plans
at
this
time
to
pay
off
those
notes
,
''
he
said
.

Eastern
Airlines
'
creditors
committee
,
unhappy
with
the
carrier
's
plans
for
emerging
from
bankruptcy-law
proceedings
,
asked
its
own
experts
to
devise
alternate
approaches
to
a
reorganization
.

Representatives
of
the
accounting
firm
of
Ernst
&
Young
and
the
securities
firm
of
Goldman
,
Sachs
&
Co.
,
hired
by
creditors
to
consult
on
Eastern
's
financial
plans
,
told
the
committee
in
a
private
meeting
yesterday
that
Eastern
's
latest
plan
to
emerge
from
bankruptcy-law
protection
is
far
riskier
than
an
earlier
one
which
won
the
creditors
'
approval
.

According
to
one
person
present
at
the
meeting
,
Eastern
's
new
plan
is
financially
``
overly
optimistic
.
''

Asked
about
the
consultants
'
reports
,
an
Eastern
spokeswoman
said
``
we
totally
disagree
.
''

She
said
they
have
``
oversimplified
and
made
some
erroneous
assumptions
that
make
their
analysis
completely
off-base
.
''

At
a
later
news
conference
here
,
Frank
Lorenzo
,
chairman
of
Eastern
's
parent
Texas
Air
Corp.
,
said
Eastern
was
exceeding
its
goals
for
getting
back
into
operation
and
predicted
it
would
emerge
from
Chapter
11
protection
from
creditors
early
next
year
,
operating
with
more
service
than
it
originally
had
scheduled
.

He
insisted
,
as
he
has
before
,
that
creditors
would
be
paid
in
full
under
the
plan
.

Mr.
Lorenzo
made
no
mention
of
creditors
'
negative
response
to
his
plan
.

``
We
're
in
the
process
of
discussing
an
amended
plan
with
the
creditors
and
anticipate
filing
that
amended
plan
shortly
,
''
Mr.
Lorenzo
told
reporters
.

``
We
're
meeting
and
surpassing
our
goals
,
''
he
added
.

In
July
,
Eastern
and
its
creditors
agreed
on
a
reorganization
plan
that
called
for
Eastern
to
sell
$
1.8
billion
in
assets
and
to
emerge
from
bankruptcy-law
protection
at
two-thirds
its
former
size
.

But
after
selling
off
pieces
such
as
its
East
Coast
shuttle
,
its
Philadelphia
hub
and
various
planes
,
Eastern
hit
a
stumbling
block
.

It
could
n't
sell
its
South
American
routes
,
one
of
the
major
assets
marked
for
disposal
.

Those
routes
,
valued
by
the
creditors
'
professionals
at
about
$
400
million
,
were
to
be
sold
to
AMR
Corp.
's
American
Airlines
.

A
last-minute
snag
in
negotiations
with
AMR
,
over
an
unrelated
lawsuit
between
American
and
another
Texas
Air
unit
,
caused
the
deal
to
collapse
.

Eastern
ultimately
decided
it
would
have
to
keep
and
operate
the
routes
itself
,
which
would
leave
it
with
less
cash
for
its
reorganization
.

It
also
would
leave
Eastern
a
bigger
carrier
than
the
scaled-down
one
proposed
under
the
initial
plan
.

Those
changes
in
its
condition
meant
the
reorganization
plan
previously
presented
to
creditors
would
have
to
be
revamped
.

Since
then
,
Eastern
has
been
negotiating
with
creditors
over
revisions
,
but
the
creditors
committee
has
been
having
problems
with
the
revisions
.

The
committee
has
two
groups
of
experts
it
calls
on
to
analyze
Eastern
's
plans
.

Both
said
the
new
plan
would
n't
work
.

Ernst
&
Young
said
Eastern
's
plans
will
miss
its
projections
of
earnings
before
interest
,
tax
and
depreciation
by
$
100
million
,
and
that
Eastern
's
plan
presented
no
comfort
level
,
according
to
a
source
present
at
yesterday
's
session
.

Experts
from
Goldman
Sachs
estimated
Eastern
would
miss
the
same
mark
by
$
120
million
to
$
135
million
,
the
source
said
.

The
experts
said
they
expected
Eastern
would
have
to
issue
new
debt
to
cover
its
costs
,
and
that
it
would
generate
far
less
cash
than
anticipated
.

Other
costs
also
would
increase
,
including
maintenance
,
because
Eastern
has
an
older
fleet
.

At
the
news
conference
,
Mr.
Lorenzo
and
Eastern
President
Phil
Bakes
presented
a
far
rosier
assessment
.

Flanked
by
flight
attendants
,
pilots
and
gate
agents
dressed
in
spiffy
new
blue
uniforms
,
they
said
Eastern
has
exceeded
its
operational
goals
and
is
filling
its
seats
.

Starting
next
month
,
Eastern
will
begin
flying
775
flights
daily
instead
of
the
previously
announced
700
,
they
said
.

Mr.
Bakes
declined
to
give
out
Eastern
's
daily
losses
,
but
said
he
did
n't
expect
Eastern
would
have
to
dip
into
the
cash
from
asset
sales
currently
held
in
escrow
.

These
accounts
hold
several
hundred
million
dollars
,
primarily
from
asset
sales
.

The
plan
Eastern
hopes
to
pursue
,
he
said
,
calls
for
Eastern
to
have
$
390
million
in
cash
by
year
's
end
.

Both
he
and
Mr.
Lorenzo
predicted
that
plan
might
be
confirmed
in
January
.

As
to
negotiations
with
creditors
,
Mr.
Lorenzo
said
in
remarks
after
the
conference
``
we
'll
have
to
see
how
they
{
talks
}
come
along
.
''

However
,
he
added
,
``
it
's
not
a
requirement
that
the
plan
be
accepted
by
creditors
.

It
must
be
accepted
by
the
court
.
''

Under
bankruptcy
law
,
Eastern
has
exclusive
rights
for
a
certain
period
to
develop
its
own
reorganization
plan
.

That
deadline
has
been
extended
once
and
could
be
extended
again
.

If
Eastern
can
get
creditor
support
,
court
confirmation
of
its
plan
could
be
relatively
swift
.

But
creditors
are
free
to
press
for
court
approval
of
their
own
plan
,
or
the
court
could
ignore
both
sides
and
draw
its
own
.

In
any
event
,
some
people
familiar
with
the
case
question
whether
the
court
will
act
by
January
as
forecast
by
Mr.
Lorenzo
and
Mr.
Bakes
.

Eastern
sought
bankruptcy-law
protection
a
few
days
after
a
crippling
strike
began
March
4
.

Mr.
Lorenzo
told
reporters
the
reorganization
Eastern
is
pursuing
would
create
a
carrier
85
%
to
90
%
of
the
size
of
the
pre-bankruptcy
Eastern
.

He
projected
it
would
be
operating
about
1,000
flights
a
day
by
late
spring
,
only
slightly
fewer
than
the
carrier
's
old
volume
of
1,050
a
day
.

HOPES
OF
SIMPLIFYING
the
corporate
minimum
tax
before
1990
are
weakening
.

The
method
of
calculating
the
20
%
tax
,
paid
if
it
exceeds
tax
figured
the
regular
way
,
is
due
for
a
change
in
1990
,
thanks
to
1986
's
tax
act
.

But
most
experts
agree
that
the
concept
that
is
to
be
introduced
drags
in
great
complexity
;
they
have
been
trying
to
head
it
off
this
year
.

Ways
and
Means
Chairman
Rostenkowski
backed
a
simplification
plan
in
the
pending
House
tax
bill
,
but
the
plan
turns
out
to
be
a
big
revenue
loser
.

Now
the
Senate
's
stripped-down
bill
omits
any
proposal
to
deal
with
the
corporate
tax
.

Proponents
of
simplification
fear
that
the
chances
of
getting
it
into
the
final
bill
are
waning
.

``
We
hear
it
has
low
priority
on
the
House
side
,
''
says
Samuel
Starr
of
Coopers
&
Lybrand
,
CPAs
.

If
the
law
is
n't
changed
,
he
says
,
``
we
are
left
staring
at
rules
that
are
almost
impossible
to
implement
,
because
there
are
so
many
complex
depreciation
calculations
to
do
.
''

But
Congress
still
could
resolve
the
issue
with
other
legislation
this
year
or
next
,
Starr
adds
.

HUGO
'S
RAVAGES
may
be
offset
by
immediate
claims
for
tax
refunds
.

This
law
aids
hurricane-wracked
locales
named
by
the
president
as
disaster
areas
,
as
well
as
regions
so
designated
after
other
1989
disasters
.

It
lets
victims
elect
to
deduct
casualty
losses
on
either
1989
or
amended
1988
returns
,
whichever
offers
the
larger
tax
benefit
;
they
have
until
April
16
to
choose
.

Amending
a
1988
return
to
claim
a
refund
brings
cash
faster
;
but
for
personal
losses
,
there
are
other
factors
to
consider
,
notes
publisher
Prentice
Hall
.

A
loss
--
after
insurance
recoveries
--
is
deductible
only
to
the
extent
that
it
exceeds
$
100
and
that
the
year
's
total
losses
exceed
10
%
of
adjusted
gross
income
;
victims
may
pick
the
year
when
income
is
lower
and
deductions
higher
.

In
filing
an
original
(
not
amended
)
return
,
a
couple
should
consider
whether
damaged
property
is
owned
jointly
or
separately
and
whether
one
spouse
has
larger
income
;
that
may
determine
whether
they
should
file
jointly
or
separately
.

THE
IRS
DELAYS
several
deadlines
for
Hugo
's
victims
.

Returns
for
1988
from
people
with
six-month
filing
extensions
were
due
Monday
,
but
the
IRS
says
people
in
the
disaster
areas
wo
n't
be
penalized
for
late
filing
if
their
returns
are
marked
``
Hugo
''
and
postmarked
by
Jan.
16
.

Interest
will
be
imposed
on
unpaid
taxes
,
but
late-payment
penalties
on
the
returns
will
be
waived
if
the
balance
due
and
paid
is
10
%
or
less
of
the
liability
.

IRS
Notice

describes
this

BIGGER
THAN
A
BREADBOX
was
this
cash
hoarder
's
reputation
for
honesty
.

People
often
cite
frugality
and
distrust
of
banks
to
justify
cash
caches
to
the
IRS
.

Gregory
Damonne
Brown
of
Fremont
,
Calif.
,
a
hardworking
,
reclusive
young
bachelor
,
told
that
story
to
the
Tax
Court
.

But
judges
usually
find
the
real
aim
is
to
escape
tax
on
hidden
income
;
and
the
IRS
said
Brown
must
have
had
such
income
--
although
it
uncovered
no
source
--
because
he
deposited
$
124,732
in
a
bank
account
in
1982-84
while
reporting
income
of
only
$
52,012
.

Brown
's
story
:

The
deposits
came
from
savings
kept
in
a
Tupperware
breadbox
;
he
saved
$
47,000
in
1974-81
by
living
with
family
members
and
pinching
pennies
and
$
45,000
of
secret
gifts
from
his
remorseful
father
,
who
had
abandoned
the
family
in
1955
.

Brown
had
no
proof
;
but
testimony
of
his
mother
and
stepmother
about
his
father
and
of
an
ex-employer
about
his
honesty
and
habits
satisfied
a
judge
that
Brown
was
truthful
and
his
tale
of
gifts
was
possible
.

The
IRS
offered
no
evidence
of
hidden
sources
of
taxable
income
,
so
Judge
Shields
rejected
its
claims
.

BRIEFS
:

Asked
how
he
made
charitable
gifts
of
$
26,350
out
of
reported
two-year
income
of
$
46,892
,
Thomas
H.
McFall
of
Bryan
,
Texas
,
told
the
Tax
Court
he
had
understated
his
income
.

The
court
rejected
his
incredible
claims
,
denied
his
deductions
,
and
imposed
a
negligence
penalty
...
.

Rep.
Schaefer
(
R.
,
Colo.

of
violent
criminals
.

Kay
Peterson
mounts
her
bicycle
and
grinds
up
yet
another
steep
,
rocky
path
seemingly
suitable
only
for
mountain
goats
.

After
a
tortuous
climb
,
she
is
rewarded
by
a
picture-postcard
vista
:
a
glade
of
golden
aspens
under
an
azure
Indian-summer
sky
.

This
place
is
12
miles
into
the
back
country
--
a
day-long
trudge
for
a
hiker
,
but
reached
by
Ms.
Peterson
and
six
others
in
a
mere
two
hours
of
pedaling
fat-tired
mountain
bikes
.

``
This
,
''
says
Ms.
Peterson
,
``
is
what
it
's
all
about
.
''

Twelve
hundred
miles
away
,
rangers
at
a
Napa
County
,
Calif.
,
state
park
are
among
the
many
who
do
n't
quite
share
the
enthusiasm
.

This
summer
,
speeding
bikers
were
blamed
for
an
accident
in
the
Napa
County
park
,
in
which
a
horse
--
spooked
on
a
trail
that
was
closed
to
bikers
--
broke
its
leg
.

The
animal
had
to
be
destroyed
;
the
bikers
fled
and
were
never
found
.

In
numerous
parks
near
San
Francisco
,
rangers
have
been
forced
to
close
trails
,
set
up
speed
traps
and
use
radar
guns
to
curb
fast
and
reckless
riding
.

They
have
even
sent
helicopters
in
pursuit
of
bikers
after
hikers
and
equestrians
complained
they
were
being
driven
from
trails
.

``
We
were
being
overrun
,
''
says
Steve
Fiala
,
trails
coordinator
of
the
East
Bay
Regional
Park
District
.

Two
years
ago
,
the
district
decided
to
limit
the
bikes
to
fire
roads
in
its
65,000
hilly
acres
.

From
about
200,000
six
years
ago
,
the
number
of
mountain
bikes
in
the
U.S.
is
expected
to
grow
to
10
million
in
1990
.

At
least
half
that
growth
will
have
come
in
the
past
three
years
alone
.

The
controversy
kicked
up
by
the
proliferation
of
these
all-terrain
bicycles
is
one
of
the
most
divisive
storms
to
blow
through
the
national
conservation
movement
in
recent
memory
.

Bikers
--
many
of
them
ardent
environmentalists
--
proclaim
their
sport
an
efficient
,
safe
,
fitness-promoting
way
to
get
back
to
nature
,
while
asserting
a
right
,
as
taxpayers
,
to
pedal
on
public
lands
.

But
the
bikes
'
burgeoning
numbers
,
safety
concerns
and
fear
that
they
damage
fragile
landscapes
have
prompted
pleas
,
from
the
Sierras
to
the
Eastern
Seaboard
,
to
ban
them
from
the
back
country
.

Key
to
the
issue
is
that
the
bikes
,
in
skillful
hands
,
can
go
virtually
anywhere
,
and
in
reckless
hands
can
become
vehicles
of
terror
.

An
adept
bicyclist
can
leap
from
a
dead
stop
to
the
top
of
a
picnic
table
without
losing
balance
.

Such
skills
allow
riders
to
fly
down
treacherous
mountain
grades
at
speeds
of
up
to
40
miles
an
hour
--
a
thrill
for
the
cyclist
but
a
nightmare
for
unsuspecting
hikers
or
equestrians
.

For
harried
public-land
managers
across
the
nation
,
the
response
is
increasingly
to
shut
the
gates
.

The
state
of
California
,
following
the
lead
of
some
regional
parks
,
recently
adopted
regulations
that
closed
nearly
all
hiking
paths
in
state
parks
to
mountain
bicycles
.

The
move
largely
consigns
them
to
roads
used
by
motorized
vehicles
.

Most
other
states
have
enacted
similar
bans
.

The
bikes
are
unwelcome
on
trails
in
national
parks
.

Even
the
U.S.
Forest
Service
,
whose
lenient
``
multiple-use
''
philosophy
permits
motorized
vehicles
on
thousands
of
miles
of
its
trails
across
the
U.S.
,
has
begun
to
close
some
lands
to
the
bikes
,
including
major
portions
of
the
popular
Pacific
Crest
Trail
,
which
stretches
from
California
to
Canada
.

Often
these
closings
come
after
vigorous
anti-bike
lobbying
by
conservation
organizations
,
the
politically
potent
Sierra
Club
among
them
.

Sierra
has
been
instrumental
in
securing
a
number
of
the
California
bans
.

It
has
been
waging
an
all-out
campaign
to
beat
back
a
proposal
,
pushed
by
Utah
bike
groups
,
to
allow
the
cycles
in
federally
designated
wilderness
areas
,
where
they
are
now
prohibited
.

Yet
Sierra
's
hard-line
stance
has
created
something
of
a
rift
in
the
organization
,
which
estimates
that
17
%
of
its
500,000
members
own
mountain
bikes
.

Pressure
from
these
members
prompted
the
club
recently
to
soften
its
anti-bike
rhetoric
;
it
no
longer
,
for
example
,
lumps
the
bikes
into
the
same
category
as
motorcycles
and
other
terrain-marring
off-road
vehicles
.

But
the
club
still
insists
that
public
lands
ought
to
be
closed
to
the
bikes
unless
studies
indicate
the
bikes
wo
n't
injure
the
environment
or
other
users
.

``
I
have
a
mountain
bike
,
yet
as
a
hiker
I
've
been
run
off
the
road
by
kids
careening
down
a
fire
trail
on
them
,
''
says
Gene
Coan
,
an
official
at
Sierra
's
headquarters
in
San
Francisco
,
echoing
the
concerns
of
many
members
.

``
People
who
feel
that
cyclists
should
be
banned
from
an
area
are
n't
looking
at
the
whole
picture
,
''
complains
Mark
Langton
,
associate
editor
of
Mountain
and
City
Biking
magazine
in
Canoga
Park
,
Calif
.

Mr.
Langton
is
among
the
legions
of
bikers
who
got
their
first
taste
of
wilderness
as
hikers
or
backpackers
.

He
says
fellow
bikers
show
the
same
concern
for
the
land
that
they
demonstrated
as
hikers
;
many
are
appalled
that
the
conservation
community
would
suddenly
consider
them
the
enemy
.

To
fight
back
,
activists
such
as
Mr.
Langton
are
forming
groups
to
lobby
land
managers
over
access
issues
and
undertake
education
programs
to
show
that
the
bikes
can
responsibly
share
trails
.

Mr.
Langton
's
group
,
Concerned
Off-Road
Bicyclists
Association
,
mounted
petition
drives
to
help
keep
open
certain
Santa
Monica
Mountain
trails
designated
for
closing
.

Biking
groups
in
Montana
,
Idaho
,
Michigan
and
Massachusetts
have
won
similar
concessions
,
says
Tim
Blumenthal
,
mountain
bike
editor
of
Bicycling
magazine
.

These
groups
have
been
trying
to
improve
the
mountain
biker
's
image
;
in
the
San
Francisco-area
park
district
where
a
ranger
was
clobbered
by
a
cyclist
this
summer
bikers
have
formed
a
volunteer
patrol
to
help
rangers
enforce
regulations
,
and
to
school
riders
in
proper
trail
etiquette
.

Even
staunch
anti-bike
Sierra
members
concede
that
10
%
of
all
riders
cause
most
of
the
problems
.

While
some
are
renegade
riders
who
simply
scorn
regulations
,
much
bad
riding
simply
reflects
ignorance
that
can
be
corrected
through
``
education
and
peer
pressure
,
''
says
Jim
Hasenauer
,
a
director
of
the
International
Mountain
Biking
Association
.

``
I
think
we
're
making
progress
.
''

Few
would
have
foreseen
such
a
furor
when
,
a
decade
ago
,
some
Marin
County
bicycle
enthusiasts
created
a
hybrid
bike
using
fat
tires
,
lightweight
metallurgy
and
multi-gear
technology
.

They
wanted
a
machine
that
would
allow
them
to
pedal
into
rugged
terrain
then
inaccessible
to
cycles
.

They
got
a
machine
more
responsive
,
more
stable
and
in
many
ways
easier
to
ride
than
the
thin-tired
racing
bikes
that
then
were
the
rage
.

When
the
bikes
first
entered
mass
production
in
1981
,
they
were
dismissed
as
a
fad
.

Last
year
,
25
%
of
the
10
million
bicycles
sold
in
the
U.S.
were
mountain
bikes
.

In
California
,
a
bellwether
market
,
they
accounted
for
more
than
80
%
of
all
bike
sales
.

The
majority
of
the
bikes
never
even
make
it
into
the
high
country
.

City
dwellers
love
them
because
they
shift
smoothly
in
traffic
,
bounce
easily
over
curbs
and
roll
through
road
glass
with
far
fewer
flat
tires
than
racing
bikes
.

Crested
Butte
,
population
1,200
,
is
a
bastion
of
the
sport
.

By
one
estimate
,
everyone
here
under
50
owns
at
least
one
bike
.

The
town
is
home
to
the
Mountain
Bike
Hall
of
Fame
and
it
hosts
the
annual
Fat
Tire
Bike
Week
.

This
summer
,
the
jamboree
attracted
more
visitors
than
the
busiest
week
of
the
town
's
winter
ski
season
.

David
Lindsey
,
chairman
of
the
Fat
Tire
Bike
celebration
,
muses
that
the
bike
's
popularity
may
be
a
combination
of
technology
and
nostalgia
.

``
The
mountain
bike
feels
as
comfortable
as
the
`
paperboy
'
bike
you
had
as
a
kid
,
but
it
can
do
so
much
more
,
''
he
says
.

The
following
issues
were
recently
filed
with
the
Securities
and
Exchange
Commission
:

Stock-market
tremors
again
shook
bond
prices
,
while
the
dollar
turned
in
a
mixed
performance
.

Early
yesterday
,
investors
scrambled
to
buy
Treasury
bonds
for
safety
as
stock
prices
plummeted
and
fears
mounted
of
a
replay
of
Friday
.

But
stocks
later
recovered
,
erasing
most
of
their
early
declines
.

That
cut
short
the
rally
in
Treasury
bonds
and
depressed
prices
moderately
below
late
Monday
's
levels
.

The
Dow
Jones
Industrial
Average
,
down
more
than
60.25
points
early
in
the
day
,
finished
18.65
points
lower
at
2638.73
.

Long-term
Treasury
issues
declined
about
half
a
point
,
or
$
5
for
each
$
1,000
face
amount
.

``
The

said
Jack
Conlon
,
an
executive
vice
president
at
Nikko
Securities
.

``
People
are
breathing
a
major
sigh
of
relief
that
the
world
did
n't
end
Monday
morning
''
or
yesterday
.

Gold
,
a
closely
watched
barometer
of
investor
anxiety
,
was
little
changed
.

The
dollar
initially
fell
against
other
major
currencies
on
news
that
the
U.S.
trade
deficit
surged
in
August
to
$
10.77
billion
.

But
the
dollar
later
rebounded
,
finishing
slightly
higher
against
the
yen
although
slightly
lower
against
the
mark
.

Federal
Reserve
officials
sent
another
signal
of
their
determination
to
shore
up
investor
confidence
.

In
an
apparent
attempt
to
keep
a
lid
on
short-term
interest
rates
,
the
Fed
once
again
pumped
money
into
the
banking
system
.

But
the
Fed
move
was
a
small
gesture
,
traders
said
.

Fed
officials
appear
reluctant
to
ease
their
credit
grip
any
further
because
a
bold
move
does
n't
appear
necessary
,
several
investment
managers
said
.

The
Fed
has
allowed
a
key
short-term
interest
rate
to
decline
about
one-quarter
percentage
point
.

The
federal
funds
rate
on
overnight
loans
between
banks
has
been
hovering
around
8
3\/4
%
,
down
from
9
%
previously
.

Although
stocks
have
led
bonds
this
week
,
some
traders
predict
that
relationship
will
reverse
during
the
next
few
weeks
.

Nikko
's
Mr.
Conlon
fears
a
huge
wave
of
Treasury
borrowing
early
next
month
will
drive
down
Treasury
bond
prices
.

That
,
coupled
with
poor
third-quarter
corporate-earnings
comparisons
,
``
will
make
trouble
for
the
equity
market
for
the
next
two
to
three
months
,
''
he
says
.

But
several
other
traders
contend
investors
have
overreacted
to
junk-bond
jitters
,
and
that
stock
prices
will
continue
to
recover
.

``
They
shot
the
whole
orchestra
just
because
the
piano
player
hit
a
bad
note
,
''
said
Laszlo
Birinyi
,
president
of
Birinyi
Associates
Inc.
,
referring
to
the
stock
market
's
plunge
Friday
on
news
of
trouble
in
financing
the
UAL
Corp
.
buy-out
.

In
major
market
activity
:
Treasury
bond
prices
fell
.

The
yield
on
30-year
Treasury
bonds
climbed
back
above
8
%
,
ending
the
day
at
8.03
%
.

The
dollar
was
mixed
.

Late
yesterday
in
New
York
,
the
dollar
rose
to
142.75
yen
from
141.80
yen
Monday
,
but
fell
to
1.8667
marks
from
1.8685
marks
.

a
15
%
jump
in
third-quarter
net
income
to
$
166.8
million
,
or
78
cents

In
the
1988
third
quarter
,
the
forest-products
company
reported
profit
of
$
144.9
million
,
or
69
cents

Sales
rose
9
%
to
$
2.57

Results
for

months
include
a
pretax
loss
of
$
33
million
from
the

program
,
and
a
gain
of
$
49
million
on
the
sale
of
a

's

.

Forest-products
operations
strengthened
in
the
third
quarter
,
while
paper
operations
were
dogged
by
higher
costs
,
soft
newsprint
exports
and
a
strong
Japanese
yen
.

Some
competing
forest-products
firms
have
recently
reported
improved
results
due
to
strong
pulp
and
paper
business
.

Weyerhaeuser
's
pulp
and
paper
operations
were
up
for
the
nine
months
,
but
full-year
performance
depends
on
the
balance
of

the

said

Looking

the

said
export
log

lumber
markets
will
be
weak

panel

Bankers
Trust
New
York
Corp.
became
the
latest
major
U.S.
bank
to
increase
reserves
for
its
loans
to
less-developed
countries
,
making
a
$
1.6
billion
third-quarter
addition
to
its
provision
.

The
bank
also
said
it
expects
to
report
a
$
1.42
billion
loss
for
the
third
quarter
and
a
loss
for
the
full
year
.

The
new
reserves
bring
the
company
's
provision
for
loans
to
Third
World
countries
to
$
2.6
billion
,
or
85
%
of
Bankers

's
medium

loans
to
these
countries
.

``

''
said
James
J.

,
analyst
at

Bruyette

,
in
approving
of
the
move
.

Bankers
Trust
``
has
had
the
capacity
to
do
this
for
some
time
,
''
the
analyst
said
.

He
expects
Citicorp
to
take
a
similar
step
this
year
.

Citicorp
yesterday
reported
a
9
%
third-quarter
earnings
drop
,
which
analysts
called
a
bit
disappointing
,
while
Manufacturers
Hanover
Corp.
posted
a
$
789
million
loss
for
the
quarter
after
adding
$
950
million
to
its
reserve
for
loans
to
less-developed
countries
.

Three
other
major
U.S.
banks
posted
earnings
increases
.

Wells
Fargo
&
Co.
of
San
Francisco
posted
a
17
%
jump
.

PNC
Financial
Corp.
,
the
parent
of
Pittsburgh
National
Bank
,
reported
net
income
climbed
9.8
%
,
while
net
for
Banc
One
Corp.
of
Columbus
,
Ohio
,
grew
3.8
%
.

Citicorp

Analysts
were
only
slightly
disappointed
by
Citicorp
's
numbers
.

``
There
's
nothing
in
here
that
's
horrible
and
nothing
to
make
you
think
they
're
setting
the
world
on
fire
,
''
said
Carole
Berger
,
analyst
for
C.J.
Lawrence
,
Morgan
Grenfell
Inc
.

Earnings
from
the
bank
's
global
consumer
business
grew
27
%
.

``
The
consumer
business
continues
to
drive
the
earnings
stream
,
''
said
Mr.
McDermott
of
Keefe
,
Bruyette
&
Woods
.

Corporate
finance
and
trading
results
in
member
countries
of
the
Organization
for
Economic
Cooperation
and
Development
were
``
relatively
flat
,
sometimes
choppy
,
''
the
bank
said
,
and
profit
for
the
area
sank
27
%
.

The
cross-border
loan
portfolio
reflected
``
adjustment
problems
and
episodic
payment
patterns
,
''
the
bank
said
no
interest
payments
from
Argentina
in
the
nine
months
and
none
from
Brazil
in
the
third
quarter
,
while
Venezuela
brought
itself
``
substantially
current
.
''

Overall
,
the
portfolio
narrowed
its
quarterly
loss
to
$
70
million
from
$
80
million
a
year
earlier
.

``
People
were
waiting
to
see
if
we
would
take
an
additional
provision
''
for
medium-term
and
long-term
loans
to
less-developed
countries
,
a
Citicorp
spokesman
said
.

But
he
reiterated
the
bank
's
position
that
it
is
comfortable
with
the
current
level
of
$
2.6
billion
,
covering
about
30
%
of
the
$
8.9
billion
of
such
loans
outstanding
.

Ronald
I.
Mandle
,
analyst
at
Sanford
C.
Bernstein
&
Co.
,
called
Citicorp
's
venture-capital
gains
of
$
93
million
before
taxes
``
strong
.
''

A
``
concerning
''
item
the
analyst
cited
was
the
10
%
jump
in
expenses
,
which
the
bank
attributes
to
costs
of
expanding
both
its
consumer
credit-card
operations
and
its
overseas
branch
business
.

Citicorp
's
spokesman
said
,
however
,
that
the
bank
is
maintaining
those
expenses
in
proportion
to
revenue
growth
.

Wells
Fargo

Wells
Fargo
continued
to
generate
one
of
the
highest
profit
margins
among
major
banks
,
minimizing
a
drop
in
net
interest
margin
with
13
%
third-quarter
growth
in
high-yielding
business
loans
and
similar
growth
in
mortgages
.

Its
margin
fell
only
seven
basis
points
,
or
7\/100ths
of
a
percentage
point
,
from
a
year
ago
,
compared
with
a
13-point
drop
at
Security
Pacific
Corp.
and
much
larger
declines
among
banks
in
other
parts
of
the
country
.

As
a
result
,
Wells
Fargo
's
net
interest
income
rose
$
36.3
million
,
or
7
%
,
to
$
537
million
for
the
quarter
.

Non-interest
income
fell
slightly
to
$
191.9
million
from
$
193.3
million
,
while
Wells
Fargo
continued
to
rigorously
control
non-interest
expense
,
which
was
almost
flat
at
$
393.4
million
.

The
combination
of
solid
loan
growth
with
tight
expense
control
gave
Wells
Fargo
a
1.25
%
return
on
average
assets
for
the
quarter
,
about
40
%
higher
than
Security
Pacific
's
and
a
profit
ratio
matched
by
only
two
or
three
other
major
banks
in
the
U.S.
.

Wells
Fargo
's
return
on
equity
increased
to
24.4
%
from
23.8
%
.

Wells
Fargo
has
sold
all
of
its
non-trade
loans
made
to
less-developed
countries
,
and
managed
to
partly
reverse
the
sharp
rise
in
domestic
non-accrual
loans
,
which
fell
8
%
from
the
previous
quarter
to
$
806.8
million
from
$
880.9
million
.

But
the
amount
was
still
39
%
higher
than
the
year-ago
level
,
and
25
%
higher
as
a
percentage
of
total
loans
.

That
trend
,
and
Wells
Fargo
's
heavy
exposure
to
leveraged
buy-outs
,
are
about
the
only
worries
analysts
have
about
Wells
Fargo
's
financial
picture
.

Wells
Fargo
is
rebuilding
its
loan-loss
reserve
,
which
increased
to
$
711
million
at
Sept.
30
from
$
664
million
the
previous
quarter
but
was
down
from
$
852
million
a
year
ago
,
when
the
bank
still
had
some
shaky
foreign
loans
.

Manufacturers
Hanover

Manufacturers
Hanover
said
that
excluding
the
addition
to
its
reserves
,
certain
tax
benefits
,
and
a
one-time
$
16
million
gain
on
the
sale
of
an
interest
in
a
foreign
leasing
company
,
third-quarter
earnings
were
$
75
million
.

The
comparable
year-earlier
number
was
$
56
million
,
a
spokesman
said
.

The
bank
's
additional
provisions
brought
reserves
for
loans
to
less-developed
countries
to
$
2.4
billion
,
covering
36
%
of
its
medium
and
long-term
loans
outstanding
to
these
nations
.

The
net
interest
margin
-
the
difference
between
the
bank
's
cost
of
funds
and
what
it
receives
as
interest
payments
--
improved
in
the
quarter
,
as
did
certain
areas
of
wholesale
banking
.

Fees
from
syndicating
loans
dropped
48
%
,
to
$
21
million
.

``
We
did
n't
take
part
in
a
lot
of
deals
''
in
the
quarter
``
because
their
credit
quality
was
poor
,
''
the
spokesman
said
.

Expenses
unrelated
to
interest
rose
5.4
%
,
to
$
541
million
.

PNC
Financial

PNC
Financial
cited
higher
income
from
sources
unrelated
to
interest
and
said
it
continues
to
cut
costs
.

Net
interest
income
in
the
third
quarter
edged
up
1.4
%
,
to
$
317.7
million
.

Trust
income
grew
15
%
,
to
$
49.9
million
,
while
service
charges
,
fees
and
commissions
increased
22
%
,
to
$
79.4
million
.

The
bank
's
total
allowance
for
credit
losses
was
$
502.1
million
,
or
1.82
%
of
total
loans
.

Prime
Minister
Rajiv
Gandhi
set
a
date
next
month
for
general
elections
that
some
analysts
say
could
cost
him
and
his
ruling
Congress
(
I
)
Party
control
of
the
government
.

Other
analysts
say
the
Indian
leader
could
retain
control
with
a
slim
majority
or
be
forced
to
rule
as
the
dominant
partner
in
a
coalition
with
other
parties
.

Elections
in
this
large
,
diverse
and
passionate
nation
are
always
hard
to
predict
.

Much
depends
on
the
opposition
,
a
loose
group
of
regional
and
ideological
parties
led
by
former
Gandhi
cabinet
minister
Vishwanath
Pratap
Singh
.

The
biggest
certainty
is
that
the
elections
will
be
a
vote
for
or
against
Mr.
Gandhi
and
his
five
years
in
power
--
five
years
of
ups
and
downs
,
promises
and
disappointments
and
wide
fluctuations
in
popularity
.

Yesterday
,
four
days
after
an
unusual
parliamentary
defeat
for
the
ruling
party
,
Mr.
Gandhi
called
elections
for
the
lower
house
of
Parliament
on
Nov.
22
and
24
.

The
elections
will
be
held
in
different
states
on
one
of
the
two
days
.

(
The
lower
house
's
five-year
term
expires
in
January
;
the
Parliament
's
upper
house
is
appointed
.
)

The
elections
will
be
a
rigorous
test
for
the
45-year-old
prime
minister
and
Congress
(
I
)
,
which
in
various
forms
has
ruled
for
40
of
India
's
42
years
of
independence
.

After
a
landslide
win
in
1984
in
polls
held
after
the
assassination
of
his
mother
,
Indira
Gandhi
,
Mr.
Gandhi
saw
his
popularity
begin
a
roller
coaster
ride
.

His
early
promises
to
make
India
a
modern
nation
remain
bogged
down
in
bloated
bureaucracy
.

His
pledge
to
clean
up
local
administration
and
Indian
politics
,
including
his
own
party
,
went
unfulfilled
.

His
``
Mr.
Clean
''
image
was
muddied
by
an
arms-kickback
scandal
,
which
will
be
a
major
campaign
issue
.

Some
analysts
predict
that
disappointment
in
Mr.
Gandhi
's
spent
pledge
to
reduce
corruption
and
heavy-handed
local
government
will
crest
at
the
polls
.

``
There
's
a
wide
feeling
of
indignation
across
the
country
,
''
says
Bhabani
Sen
Gupta
of
the
Center
for
Policy
Research
,
in
New
Delhi
.

``
I
think
the
people
will
be
judging
the
regime
by
a
petty
policeman
,
by
a
corrupt
revenue
collector
.

This
could
be
a
big
protest
against
an
administrative
failure
.
''

Even
if
the
Congress
(
I
)
retains
control
of
the
government
,
Mr.
Gandhi
's
ability
to
push
through
major
initiatives
might
be
hobbled
by
a
thinner
majority
.

Economic
analysts
call
his
trail-blazing
liberalization
of
the
Indian
economy
incomplete
,
and
many
are
hoping
for
major
new
liberalizations
if
he
is
returned
firmly
to
power
.

The
Lok
Sabha
,
or
lower
house
of
Parliament
,
has
542
elected
and
two
appointed
seats
.

In
1984
,
the
Congress
(
I
)
captured
405
seats
,
the
largest
victory
in
the
history
of
Indian
democracy
.

The
landslide
was
fueled
by
panic
that
prevailed
in
India
at
the
time
.

Mrs.
Gandhi
had
been
assassinated
by
separatist
Sikhs
,
and
many
Indians
feared
their
country
might
split
apart
.

In
the
previous
three
general
elections
,
similar
national
issues
clinched
the
vote
.

In
1971
,
the
Congress
Party
won
after
India
's
victory
in
the
Bangladesh
war
.

In
1977
,
Mrs.
Gandhi
was
thrown
out
of
office
after
her
19-month
emergency
rule
,
and
in
1980
,
after
her
successors
made
a
mess
of
their
three
years
in
power
,
she
was
restored
to
office
.

Most
political
analysts
say
that
if
Mr.
Gandhi
's
opposition
unites
to
field
single
candidates
in
most
precincts
,
the
Congress
(
I
)
will
lose
big
.

But
if
the
opposition
remains
fractured
,
the
Congress
(
I
)
could
win
a
small
majority
,
or
lead
a
coalition
government
.

Chimanbhai
Mehta
,
a
parliamentarian
and
former
Gandhi
ally
,
predicts
Congress
(
I
)
will
win
only
150
seats
,
a
quarter
of
the
house
,
if
the
opposition
fields
single
candidates
in
80
%
of
the
races
.

Analysts
say
the
opposition
will
struggle
this
week
to
unite
,
and
its
success
will
be
clear
only
when
it
announces
its
final
list
of
parliamentary
candidates
.

The
arms-kickback
scandal
is
likely
to
be
one
of
the
big
talking
points
in
the
campaign
,
but
it
's
unclear
how
it
is
viewed
by
average
Indian
voters
.

In
1986
,
India
signed
a
$
1.4
billion
contract
with
AB
Bofors
,
a
unit
of
Nobel
Industries
Sweden
AB
,
to
purchase
400
artillery
pieces
.

The
contract
was
negotiated
by
the
countries
'
two
prime
ministers
,
and
was
supposed
to
be
free
of
commissions
or
agents
'
costs
.

In
April
1987
,
evidence
surfaced
that
commissions
were
paid
.

The
opposition
charged
that
the
money
was
used
to
bribe
Indian
government
officials
,
an
allegation
denied
by
Mr.
Gandhi
's
administration
.

But
many
of
his
statements
on
the
issue
in
Parliament
subsequently
were
proven
wrong
by
documentary
evidence
.

The
scandal
has
faded
and
flared
,
but
recent
disclosures
propelled
it
back
onto
the
front
pages
,
and
that
has
helped
galvanize
the
opposition
,
which
last
week
blocked
passage
of
two
constitutional
amendment
bills
.

It
was
the
first
time
in
20
years
that
such
government
bills
were
defeated
.

In
a
country
where
a
bribe
is
needed
to
get
a
phone
,
a
job
,
and
even
into
a
school
,
the
name
Bofors
has
become
a
potent
rallying
cry
against
the
government
.

That
illustrates
the
kind
of
disappointment
many
Indians
feel
toward
Mr.
Gandhi
,
whom
they
zestfully
elected
and
enthusiastically
supported
in
his
first
two
years
in
power
.

His
term
has
produced
no
spectacular
failures
in
politics
,
in
the
economy
or
on
the
military
front
,
and
has
chalked
up
some
successes
.

But
the
average
Indian
had
tremendous
hope
in
the
youthful
leader
and
his
promise
to
make
both
government
and
the
ruling
party
more
effective
and
less
corrupt
.

His
failures
in
those
two
areas
deeply
,
and
sometimes
bitterly
,
disappointed
many
Indians
.

``
We
do
n't
like
the
Congress
(
I
)
,
''
says
Sooraji
Jath
,
a
farmer
in
the
western
state
of
Gujarat
.

``
The
Congress
government
is
taking
the
farmers
'
bread
and
not
giving
us
any
support
.

When
there
are
well
problems
,
light
problems
,
road
problems
,
the
government
tells
us
to
forget
it
.
''

The
greatest
thing
going
for
Mr.
Gandhi
and
the
Congress
(
I
)
Party
is
the
poor
reputation
of
the
opposition
.

Even
if
it
unites
for
the
elections
,
its
coherence
is
likely
to
be
temporary
.

When
the
Congress
(
I
)
lost
the
1977
election
,
following
Mrs.
Gandhi
's
hated
emergency
rule
,
a
similar
coalition
took
power
and
then
disintegrated
.

Many
Indians
fear
a
repeat
of
that
experience
.

March
24
,
1986
:

AB
Bofors
,
a
unit
of
Nobel
Industries
Sweden
AB
,
enters
into
a
$
1.4
billion
contract
with
India
's
Defense
Ministry
to
supply
400
Bofors
FH-77B
155-mm
field
howitzer
guns
.

In
1985
,
Prime
Minister
Rajiv
Gandhi
,
in
his
talks
with
then
Swedish
Prime
Minister
Olof
Palme
,
imposed
the
condition
that
the
contract
have
no
middlemen
.

April
16
,
1987
:

Swedish
National
Radio
reports
that
about
$
40
million
--
nearly
3
%
of
the
total
contract
--
was
paid
by
Bofors
as
commissions
to
middlemen
.

June
1
,
1987
:

Sweden
's
National
Audit
Bureau
releases
its
report
confirming
payment
of
about
$
40
million
to
unidentified
Indians
.

The
report
says
that
investigations
were
severely
hampered
by
lack
of
cooperation
from
Bofors
.

Bofors
says
it
ca
n't
disclose
the
names
of
the
middlemen
because
it
would
jeopardize
industrial
confidentiality
.

A
portion
of
the
report
containing
names
of
the
middlemen
is
withheld
by
officials
citing
bank
secrecy
requirements
.

Aug.
6
,
1987
:

Prime
Minister
Gandhi
tells
the
Indian
Parliament
,
``
...
neither
I
nor
any
member
of
my
family
has
received
any
consideration
in
these
transactions
.

That
is
the
truth
.
''

Aug.
26
,
1987
:

Bofors
admits
payments
of
$
41
million
to
middlemen
.

April
22
,
1988
:

The
Hindu
newspaper
publishes
facsimiles
of
bank
documents
for
foreign-exchange
remittances
and
letters
between
Bofors
and
certain
private
companies
related
to
the
sale
of
the
guns
to
India
.

April
26
,
1988
:

A
parliamentary
investigative
committee
dominated
by
the
Congress
(
I
)
Party
concludes
that
there
were
no
middlemen
in
the
deal
and
no
payment
to
any
Indian
individual
or
company
.

July
18
,
1989
:

The
comptroller
and
auditor-general
of
India
reports
serious
lapses
in
the
government
's
technical
and
financial
evaluation
of
the
Bofors
deal
.

Sept.
15
,
1989
:

Retired
army
Chief
of
Staff
Krishnaswami
Sundarji
discloses
in
an
interview
that
he
suggested
in
May
1987
that
the
government
cancel
the
Bofors
contract
.

According
to
Gen.
Sundarji
,
that
would
have
forced
Bofors
to
disclose
the
names
of
the
middlemen
who
received
kickbacks
from
the
company
.

His
recommendation
was
rejected
by
the
government
.

Oct.
9.
1989
:

The
Hindu
newspaper
publishes
the
withheld
portion
of
the
Swedish
National
Audit
Bureau
's
report
.

The
disclosures
state
that
commissions
were
paid
by
Bofors
to
an
Indian
agent
of
the
arms
company
.

Parsow
Partnership
Ltd.
and
Elkhorn
Partners
L.P.
said
they
may
seek
proposals
from
third
parties
relating
to
a
sale
or
restructuring
of
CACI
International
Inc
.

In
a
filing
with
the
Securities
and
Exchange
Commission
,
Parsow
and
Elkhorn
,
which
together
hold
8.685
%
of
CACI
's
common
shares
,
said
they
think
it
is
in
the
best
interest
of
CACI
stockholders
that
the
company
be
sold
.

CACI
,
based
in
Arlington
,
Va.
,
said
it
had
n't
seen
the
filing
by
Parsow
and
Elkhorn
and
therefore
had
no
comment
.

The
partnerships
said
they
may
seek
board
representation
,
and
they
may
seek
the
support
of
CACI
's
board
and
other
major
shareholders
in
connection
with
their
plans
.

According
to
the
filing
,
Parsow
and
Elkhorn
are
based
in
Elkhorn
,
Neb.
,
and
are
controlled
by
the
same
general
partner
,
Alan
S.
Parsow
.

Their
combined
stake
consists
of
880,500
CACI
common
shares
,
including
86,500
shares
bought
in
the
past
60
days
at
$
2.3125
to
$
2.4375
a
share
.

Additional
shares
may
be
bought
or
sold
in
the
open
market
,
in
private
transactions
or
otherwise
,
depending
on
market
conditions
and
other
factors
.

The
inverse
trading
relationship
between
bonds
and
stocks
was
interrupted
yesterday
as
bonds
fell
despite
a
modest
decline
in
stock
prices
.

But
bond
investors
continue
to
keep
a
close
watch
on
the
jittery
stock
market
.

In
early
trading
,
investors
were
bidding
bond
prices
higher
as
stocks
tumbled
and
fears
mounted
that
Friday
's
stock
market
debacle
would
be
repeated
.

But
a
partial
recovery
in
the
Dow
Jones
Industrial
Average
,
which
had
been
down
more
than
60
points
in
midmorning
,
dashed
those
expectations
.

Treasury
bonds
also
were
hurt
late
in
the
day
by
a
$
4
billion
offering
by
the
Tennessee
Valley
Authority
and
the
prospect
of
a
huge
amount
of
new
agency
debt
.

``
Bond
investors
were
hoping
that
stock
prices
would
continue
to
fall
,
''
said
Roger
Early
,
a
vice
president
at
Federated
Investors
Inc.
,
Pittsburgh
.

``
When
stocks
stabilized
,
that
was
a
disappointment
.
''

Meanwhile
,
for
the
second
straight
day
,
the
bond
market
paid
little
attention
to
the
Federal
Reserve
's
open
market
operations
.

Fed
officials
injected
more
cash
into
the
banking
system
by
arranging
$
1.5
billion
of
repurchase
agreements
during
the
usual
pre-noon
intervention
period
.

The
move
was
meant
to
keep
a
lid
on
interest
rates
and
to
boost
investor
confidence
.

``
The
intervention
has
been
friendly
,
meaning
that
they
really
did
n't
have
to
do
it
,
''
said
Maria
Fiorini
Ramirez
,
money-market
economist
at
Drexel
Burnham
Lambert
Inc
.

She
said
a
more
aggressive
move
was
n't
needed
.

The
Fed
also
appears
reluctant
to
ease
credit
conditions
further
.

It
already
has
allowed
the
closely
watched
federal
funds
rate
to
decline
1\/4
percentage
point
to
about
8
3\/4
%
from
its
previous
target
level
of
about
9
%
.

The
rate
,
which
banks
charge
each
other
on
overnight
loans
,
is
considered
an
early
signal
of
changes
in
Fed
policy
.

It
ended
at
about
8
11\/16
%
yesterday
,
but
was
as
low
as
8
1\/2
%
Monday
.

The
Treasury
's
benchmark
30-year
bond
fell
more
than
1\/2
point
,
or
over
$
5
for
each
$
1,000
face
amount
,
while
the
yield
moved
above
8
%
for
the
first
time
since
Thursday
.

Investment-grade
corporate
,
municipal
and
mortgage-backed
securities
also
fell
.

But
most
junk
bonds
closed
unchanged
after
opening
slightly
higher
on
bargain-hunting
by
institutional
investors
.

Some
so-called
high-quality
junk
issues
,
such
as
R.H.
Macy
&
Co.
's
14
1\/2
%
subordinated
debentures
,
rose
.

The
Macy
's
issue
closed
up
about
one
point
at
a
bid
price
of
97
.

The
TVA
's
public
debt
offering
was
its
first
in
15
years
.

Strong
investor
demand
prompted
it
to
boost
the
size
of
the
issue
from
$
3
billion
.

Traders
said
hedging
related
to
the
TVA
pricing
also
pressured
Treasury
bonds
.

``
Underwriters
of
the
TVA
bonds
reduced
their
market
risk
by
selling
Treasurys
to
cover
at
least
part
of
their
{
TVA
}
holdings
,
''
said
James
R.
Capra
,
a
senior
vice
president
at
Shearson
Lehman
Government
Securities
Inc
.

The
TVA
bonds
also
``
served
to
remind
the
market
that
there
will
be
even
more
new
supply
,
''
said
Lawrence
N.
Leuzzi
,
a
managing
director
at
S.G.
Warburg
Securities
&
Co
.

Today
the
Treasury
will
announce
the
size
of
its
next
two-year
note
sale
and
Resolution
Funding
Corp.
will
announce
details
of
its
first
bond
offering
.

Some
traders
estimate
$
9.75
billion
of
new
two-year
Treasurys
will
be
sold
next
week
,
and
they
expect
Refcorp
to
offer
$
4
billion
to
$
6
billion
of
long-term
``
bailout
''
bonds
.

Refcorp
was
created
to
help
fund
the
thrift
bailout
.

Another
agency
issue
came
to
market
yesterday
.

The
Office
of
Finance
of
the
Federal
Home
Loan
Banks
said
it
priced
a
four-part
$
2.27
billion
bond
offering
for
the
banks
to
yield
from
8.125
%
to
8.375
%
.

The
release
of
several
economic
reports
had
little
impact
on
the
market
,
including
a
report
that
the
U.S.
trade
deficit
expanded
to
a
surprisingly
wide
$
10.77
billion
in
August
,
up
from
a
revised
$
8.24
billion
in
July
.

The
August
gap
was
expected
to
have
expanded
to
$
9.1
billion
.

Treasury
Securities

Treasury
securities
were
essentially
flat
to
about
1\/2
point
lower
.

The
benchmark
30-year
bond
was
quoted
late
at
100
28\/32
to
yield
8.04
%
,
compared
with
101
19\/32
to
yield
7.97
%
Monday
.

The
latest
10-year
notes
were
quoted
late
at
99
25\/32
to
yield
8.01
%
,
compared
with
100
1\/32
to
yield
7.97
%
.

Short-term
rates
increased
.

The
discount
rate
on
three-month
bills
rose
to
7.52
%
for
a
bond-equivalent
yield
of
7.75
%
.

The
rate
on
six-month
bills
rose
to
7.53
%
for
a
bond-equivalent
yield
of
7.92
%
.

Corporate
,
Other
Issues

Investment-grade
corporate
bonds
ended
1\/4
to
1\/2
point
lower
,
while
most
junk
bonds
ended
unchanged
.

The
TVA
's
huge
$
4
billion
offering
dominated
attention
in
the
new-issue
market
.

TVA
offered
$
2
billion
of
30-year
bonds
priced
to
yield
9.06
%
;
$
1
billion
in
10-year
notes
priced
to
yield
8.42
%
;
and
$
1
billion
in
five-year
notes
priced
to
yield
8.33
%
.

The
TVA
,
which
operates
one
of
the
nation
's
largest
electric
power
systems
,
is
a
corporation
wholly
owned
by
the
U.S.
government
.

Yesterday
's
bond
sale
was
part
of
a
$
6.7
billion
refinancing
plan
to
pay
off
high-interest
debt
the
TVA
owes
the
Federal
Financing
Bank
,
an
arm
of
the
Treasury
.

Meanwhile
,
Lockheed
Corp.
priced
a
$
300
million
note
offering
to
yield
9.39
%
.

Mortgage-Backed
Securities

The
derivative
mortgage-backed
market
revived
after
a
brief
hiatus
as
two
new
Remics
totaling
$
850
million
were
offered
and
talk
circulated
about
two
more
issues
that
could
be
priced
today
.

The
revival
of
the
real
estate
mortgage
investment
conduit
market
reflected
the
relative
calm
in
the
mortgage
market
after
two
days
of
volatile
trading
.

Dealers
noted
that
it
's
difficult
to
structure
new
Remics
when
prices
are
moving
widely
.

The
two
Remics
priced
were
a
$
500
million
Federal
Home
Loan
Mortgage
Corp.
issue
underwritten
by
Salomon
Brothers
Inc.
and
a
$
350
million
Federal
National
Mortgage
Association
deal
underwritten
by
Greenwich
Capital
Markets
.

The
Remic
issuance
supported
prices
of
Freddie
Mac
and
Fannie
Mae
securities
,

Municipals

Confusion
over
the
near-term
trend
for
rates
dominated
the
municipal
arena
,
as
gyrations
in
the
stock
market
continued
to
buffet
bonds
.

Long

mostly
flat
to

Foreign

West

took
a
wild
roller-coaster
ride
,
pulled
down
by
Monday
's

then
up
by
a
wider-than-expected
U.S.
trade
deficit
and
falling
U.S.

.

West

A
House-Senate
conference
approved
an
estimated
$
67
billion
fiscal
1990
spending
bill
that
provides
a
28
%
increase
for
space
research
and
development
and
incorporates
far-reaching
provisions
affecting
the
federal
mortgage
market
.

The
current
ceiling
on
home
loans
insured
by
the
Federal
Housing
Administration
would
be
increased
to
$
124,875
.

Separately
,
the
bill
gives
authority
to
the
Bush
administration
to
facilitate
the
refinancing
of
federally
subsidized
loans
for
low-income
and
moderate-income
homeowners
.

The
second
provision
,
affecting
so-called
235
mortgages
,
has
met
strong
opposition
from
investment
bankers
represented
by
the
Public
Securities
Association
.

And
a
squad
of
influential
former
Senate
aides
employed
by
the
Wall
Street
firm
Salomon
Brothers
came
to
the
Capitol
in
a
vain
attempt
to
strip
the
provision
.

By
an
11-2
margin
,
Senate
negotiators
voted
to
preserve
the
235
mortgage
refinancing
plan
,
and
despite
powerful
allies
,
the
opposition
found
itself
undercut
by
an
unusual
alliance
of
liberals
and
conservatives
.

The
government
currently
is
subsidizing
an
estimated
23,000
loans
above
11
%
under
the
235
program
,
and
however
disruptive
to
private
investors
,
the
refinancing
is
expected
to
yield
at
least
$
15
million
in
savings
in
fiscal
1990
.

This
sum
has
been
guarded
jealously
by
appropriators
anxious
to
offset
spending
elsewhere
,
and
conservative
Sen.
Phil
Gramm
cast
the
fight
as
a
populist
stand
against
monied
interests
.

``
We
are
stewards
here
,
not
of
the
mortgage
companies
,
but
the
taxpayers
,
''
said
the
Texas
Republican
.

The
action
came
as
the
administration
won
final
congressional
approval
of
$
9
million
in
assistance
for
elections
scheduled
in
Nicaragua
in
February
.

The
bulk
of
the
money
would
be
funneled
through
the
National
Endowment
for
Democracy
,
but
the
legislation
is
so
vaguely
written
that
it
has
been
dogged
by
questions
regarding
the
money
's
true
purpose
and
its
ultimate
destination
.

The
Senate
had
refused
late
Friday
to
invoke
cloture
and
limit
debate
,
but
behind
the
bipartisan
leadership
,
a
solid
majority
took
shape
yesterday
and
brushed
aside
amendments
seeking
to
cut
the
total
package
or
steer
it
away
from
direct
aid
to
political
parties
.

Final
approval
--
on
a
64-35
roll
call
--
was
never
in
doubt
,
but
the
opposition
drew
an
unusual
mix
of
senators
,
including
Republicans
Jesse
Helms
and
Warren
Rudman
and
Democrats
Bill
Bradley
and
John
Glenn
.

The
money
will
be
applied
for
voter
registration
and
election
monitoring
,
but
more
than
half
is
likely
to
go
to
the
Union
Nacional
Opositora
party
.

Critics
warned
such
cash
contributions
may
only
undercut
the
opposition
party
's
standing
,
and
one
irony
is
that
under
Nicaraguan
law
a
major
portion
of
the
opposition
party
's
funds
must
be
shared
with
the
government
's
Supreme
Electoral
Council
.

Within
the
appropriations
conference
yesterday
,
the
$
67
billion
measure
is
the
second
largest
of
the
annual
domestic
spending
bills
and
covers
a
disparate
collection
of
accounts
for
science
,
housing
,
veterans
and
the
environment
.

The
decision
to
raise
the
ceiling
on
FHA
home
loans
still
faces
strong
opposition
in
the
House
.

But
it
is
driven
by
the
same
fiscal
pressures
that
have
forced
lawmakers
to
resort
to
various
bookkeeping
devices
to
juggle
as
much
as
$
1
billion
in
spending
that
would
otherwise
put
the
bill
over
budget
.

These
costs
will
complicate
the
budget
picture
in
fiscal
1991
,
and
the
measure
further
commits
Congress
to
a
set
of
costly
projects
,
including
the
first
construction
funds
for
the
space
station
.

The
station
is
promised
$
1.8
billion
within
the
$
5.36
billion
provided
for
research
and
development
in
the
National
Aeronautics
and
Space
Administration
,
and
the
nation
's
high-speed
aerospace
plane
--
cut
by
the
Senate
--
could
receive
as
much
as
$
60
million
in
new
funds
or
transfers
.

Similarly
,
the
House
agreed
to
add
back
$
62
million
to
continue
work
on
the
advanced
communications
technology
satellite
,
being
developed
by
General
Electric
Co
.

And
while
setting
a
statutory
limit
of
$
1.6
billion
on
the
automated
space
probe
,
the
conference
appropriated
$
30
million
for
the
start-up
of
the
CRAF-Cassini
mission
,
a
successor
to
the
Voyager
space
probe
.

Among
major
domestic
agencies
,
the
Environmental
Protection
Agency
stands
to
receive
increases
significantly
beyond
those
sought
by
the
administration
,
with
pollution
abatement
and
control
accounts
growing
by
14
%
to
about
$
829.9
million
.

An
estimated
$
1.57
billion
is
separately
allocated
for
the
National
Science
Foundation
,
and
within
the
Housing
and
Urban
Development
Department
,
more
than
$
9.2
billion
is
provided
for
federally
assisted
housing
,
including
an
expanded
effort
to
modernize
public
housing
units
that
serve
the
poorest
families
.

To
an
unusual
degree
,
the
massive
bill
has
become
a
vehicle
for
lawmakers
to
earmark
funds
for
projects
in
home
states
.

While
the
practice
was
discouraged
in
the
past
,
the
conference
agreement
is
laced
with
veterans
'
hospitals
,
environmental
projects
and
urban
grants
designated
for
specific
communities
.

The
most
striking
example
yesterday
may
have
been
in
community
development
funds
,
where
the
two
houses
had
separately
approved
a
total
of
27
projects
valued
at
$
20
million
,
and
the
conference
added
15
more
valued
at
$
8
million
to
ostensibly
preserve
``
balance
''
between
the
House
and
Senate
.

Yesterday
's
conference
agreement
is
the
second
major
bill
to
emerge
from
negotiations
this
week
,
as
appropriators
approved
a
fiscal
1990
transportation
bill
late
Monday
that
includes
a
sweeping
ban
on
smoking
on
most
domestic
airline
flights
.

An
exemption
will
remain
for
flights
longer
than
six
hours
to
Hawaii
and
Alaska
,
but
estimates
by
the
tobacco
industry
yesterday
indicate
all
but
about
30
flights
would
be
covered
.

Separately
,
a
third
conference
report
covering
an
$
18.4
billion
Treasury
and
Postal
Service
bill
was
sent
to
the
Senate
after
passing
the
House
on
a
383-30
roll
call
yesterday
.

And
after
weeks
of
delay
,
the
appropriations
process
is
beginning
to
take
some
final
shape
.

Defense
and
foreign
aid
are
the
two
most
critical
areas
remaining
from
the
administration
's
standpoint
.

And
among
domestic
programs
,
the
most
serious
threat
is
White
House
opposition
to
abortion
riders
attached
to
separate
bills
funding
the
District
of
Columbia
and
Department
of
Health
and
Human
Services
.

The
same
issue
threatens
to
spill
over
to
the
foreign
aid
debate
,
and
Mr.
Bush
also
is
threatening
to
veto
any
agreement
that
preserves
Senate-passed
provisions
renewing
U.S.
support
for
the
United
Nations
Fund
for
Population
Activities
.

In
a
sharply
written
letter
,
Rep.
David
Obey
,
chairman
of
the
House
appropriations
subcommittee
for
foreign
operations
,
warned
Mr.
Bush
that
the
result
of
his
``
ultimatum
''
could
weaken
efforts
to
accommodate
the
administration
elsewhere
.

``
As
a
result
of
your
ultimatum
,
''
writes
the
Wisconsin
Democrat
,
``
I
guess
there
is
no
longer
any
point
in
taking
administration
views
into
account
on
other
items
in
conference
,
inasmuch
regardless
of
their
resolution
you
apparently
intend
to
veto
this
bill
.

Markets
usually
get
noticed
because
they
soar
or
plunge
.

Gold
,
which
has
n't
risen
or
fallen
significantly
in
quite
some
time
,
yesterday
achieved
what
may
be
a
new
level
of
impassiveness
:
The
most
actively
traded
futures
contracts
closed
unchanged
despite
nervous
fluctuations
in
both
the
dollar
and
the
stock
market
.

The
settlement
prices
of
the
December
,
February
and
April
gold
contracts
were
even
with
Monday
's
final
prices
.

The
December
1989
contract
,
which
has
the
greatest
trading
volume
,
ended
at
$
371.20
an
ounce
.

The
other
months
posted
advances
of
10
cents
to
20
cents
an
ounce
.

According
to
one
analyst
,
Bernard
Savaiko
of
PaineWebber
,
New
York
,
the
stock
market
's
ability
on
Monday
to
rally
from
last
Friday
's
decline
--
which
seemed
to
indicate
that
the
economy
was
n't
going
to
fall
either
--
took
the
starch
out
of
precious
metals
prices
,
and
out
of
gold
's
,
in
particular
.

Yesterday
,
gold
traded
within
a
narrow
range
.

Gold
tried
to
rally
on
Monday
but
ran
into
the
same
situation
that
has
subdued
gold
prices
for
more
than
a
year
:
selling
by
gold
producers
,
who
want
to
fix
the
highest
possible
price
for
their
gold
.

``
December
delivery
gold
is
trading
in
a
range
of
$
365
to
$
375
{
an
ounce
}
and
is
having
difficulty
breaking
out
above
that
,
''
Mr.
Savaiko
said
.

``
Producers
at
the
moment
regard
that
area
a
good
one
in
which
to
sell
gold
.
''

Also
,
Mr.
Savaiko
noted
,
stock
market
investors
seeking
greater
safety
are
veering
toward
buying
bonds
rather
than
precious
metals
because
``
we
are
tending
more
toward
a
disinflationary
economy
that
does
n't
make
gold
and
precious
metals
attractive
.
''

Jeffrey
Nichols
,
president
of
APMS
Canada
,
Toronto
precious
metals
advisers
,
said
there
is
little
to
motivate
gold
traders
to
buy
the
metal
.

``
Investors
in
the
U.S.
and
Europe
are
comfortable
with
the
actions
of
the
{
Federal
Reserve
}
in
its
willingness
to
supply
liquidity
to
financial
system
,
which
helped
the
stock
market
rebound
on
Monday
,
''
he
said
.

There
is
n't
any
rush
on
the
part
of
investors
in
the
West
to
buy
gold
,
he
said
.

``
They
still
bear
the
memory
of
October
1987
,
when
they
bought
gold
after
the
stock
market
crashed
and
ended
up
losing
money
because
gold
prices
subsequently
fell
,
''
Mr.
Nichols
said
.

``
It
's
an
experience
they
do
n't
want
to
repeat
.
''

At
the
moment
gold
traders
are
n't
concerned
about
inflation
,
he
said
,
and
as
for
the
dollar
,
``
gold
's
association
with
the
currency
has
been
diminishing
recently
so
drops
in
the
currency
are
n't
having
much
impact
on
gold
.
''

Dinsa
Mehta
,
chief
bullion
trader
for
Chase
Manhattan
Bank
,
said
:
``
There
is
little
incentive
on
the
part
of
traders
to
sell
gold
because
the
stock
market
may
go
lower
and
gold
may
retain
some
of
its
`
flight
to
safety
'
quality
.

There
is
little
incentive
to
buy
gold
because
if
the
stock
market
goes
higher
,
it
may
be
just
a
false
alarm
.

This
is
keeping
the
gold
traders
handcuffed
.
''

The
most
remarkable
feature
about
yesterday
's
action
was
that
the
price
of
roughly
$
370
an
ounce
was
regarded
as
attractive
enough
by
gold
producers
around
the
world
to
aggressively
sell
gold
,
Mr.
Mehta
said
.

``
I
do
n't
know
what
it
means
over
the
long
run
,
but
for
the
short
term
,
it
appears
that
gold
producers
are
grateful
for
the
$
10
or
so
that
gold
has
risen
over
the
past
week
or
so
,
''
he
said
.

Previously
,
he
noted
,
gold
producers
tended
to
back
off
from
a
rising
gold
market
,
letting
prices
rise
as
much
as
possible
before
selling
.

Mr.
Mehta
observed
that
the
U.S.
merchandise
trade
deficit
,
which
rose
sharply
in
August
,
according
to
yesterday
's
report
,
has
been
having
less
and
less
impact
on
the
gold
market
.

``
The
dollar
has
n't
reacted
much
to
it
,
so
gold
has
n't
either
,
''
he
said
.

In
other
commodity
markets
yesterday
:

ENERGY
:

Crude
oil
prices
rose
slightly
in
lackluster
activity
as
traders
in
the
pits
tried
to
assess
action
in
the
stock
market
.

Since
stock
market
indexes
plummeted
last
Friday
,
participants
in
all
markets
have
been
wary
.

When
traders
become
confident
that
the
stock
market
has
stabilized
,
oil
prices
are
expected
to
rise
as
supply
and
demand
fundamentals
once
again
become
the
major
consideration
.

Crude
oil
for
November
delivery
edged
up
by
16
cents
a
barrel
to
$
20.75
a
barrel
.

Heating
oil
prices
also
rose
.

November
gasoline
slipped
slightly
.

SUGAR
:

Futures
prices
rose
on
a
report
that
Cuba
may
seek
to
postpone
some
sugar
shipments
.

The
March
contract
advanced
0.14
cent
a
pound
to
14.11
cents
.

According
to
an
analyst
,
Cuba
ca
n't
meet
all
its
shipment
commitments
and
has
asked
Japan
to
accept
a
delay
of
shipments
scheduled
for
later
this
year
,
into
early
next
year
.

``
Japan
is
perceived
as
a
wealthy
nation
that
can
turn
elsewhere
in
the
world
market
and
buy
the
sugar
,
''
the
analyst
said
.

It
was
the
possibility
of
this
demand
that
helped
firm
prices
,
the
analyst
said
.

Another
analyst
noted
that
Cuba
has
been
deferring
shipments
in
recent
years
.

``
To
the
professionals
in
the
trade
it
did
n't
cause
much
surprise
.

The
March
futures
contract
traded
as
high
as
14.24
cents
,
but
could
n't
sustain
the
advance
,

he
said

LIVESTOCK
AND
MEATS
:

The
prices
of
cattle
,
hogs
and
pork
belly
futures
contracts
rebounded
as
livestock
traders
shook
off
fears
that
the
Friday
stock
market
plunge
would
chill
consumer
spending
,
which
in
turn
would
hurt
retail
sales
of
beef
and
pork
.

The
prices
of
most
livestock
futures
contracts
had
dropped
sharply
Monday
.

Cattle
futures
prices
were
also
supported
yesterday
by
signs
that
supermarket
chains
are
making
plans
to
increase
their
promotions
concerning
beef
.

GRAINS
AND
SOYBEANS
:

The
prices
of
most
soybean
and
soybean-meal
futures
contracts
rose
amid
rumors
that
the
Soviet
Union
is
interested
in
buying
from
the
U.S.
or
South
America
about
250,000
metric
tons
of
soybeans
and
as
many
as
400,000
metric
tons
of
soybean
meal
.

Traders
are
especially
sensitive
to
reports
of
possible
U.S.
soybean
sales
because
U.S.
exports
are
lagging
.

Since
Sept.
1
,
about
13
million
fewer
bushels
of
U.S.
soybeans
have
been
sold
overseas
than
for
the
same
period
last
year
.

Corn
futures
prices
rose
slightly
while
wheat
prices
settled
mixed
.

Moody
's
Investors
Service
Inc.
,
fretting
about
increasing
competitive
pressure
on
Ryder
,
placed
about
$
2.8
billion
in
company
securities
under
review
for
possible
downgrade
.

Ratings
under
review
are
Ryder
's
A-1
collateral
trust
debentures
,
A-2
senior
notes
and
bonds
,
A-2
preferred
stock
and
the
company
's
Prime-1
rating
for
commercial
paper
.

Moody
's
said
it
is
assessing
the
strategies
Ryder
's
management
may
follow
in
addressing
significant
challenges
in
some
major
markets
.

The
rating
agency
said
it
is
focusing
especially
on
the
transportation
service
company
's
efforts
to
control
costs
,
improve
margins
and
enhance
its
competitive
position
in
its
primary
business
,
vehicle
leasing
and
rental
.

The
nations
of
southern
Africa
know
a
lot
about
managing
elephants
;
their
herds
are
thriving
.

But
the
nations
of
Europe
and
North
America
have
decided
they
know
better
.

At
this
week
's
U.N.
conference
in
Lausanne
,
they
imposed
a
global
ivory
ban
that
seeks
to
overturn
local
policies
.

A
Zimbabwean
delegate
argued
that
the
ban
would
``
guarantee
the
extinction
of
the
elephant
.
''

Legitimate
ranchers
,
who
have
an
interest
in
preserving
the
herds
,
would
go
out
of
business
.

Poachers
would
control
the
underground
trade
.

Many
delegates
were
willing
to
craft
a
compromise
,
but
U.S.
delegate
Constance
Harriman
and
others
thundered
that
down
.

The
Greens
from
the
First
World
wanted
a
morality
play
,
not
a
negotiation
.

Fortunately
,
the
nations
of
southern
Africa
have
n't
totally
surrendered
their
sovereignty
.

Five
countries
announced
they
would
not
honor
what
one
Zimbabwean
delegate
wryly
called
the
``
made
in
Switzerland
''
solution
.

In
fact
,
they
seemed
a
mite
resentful
.

The
director
of
Zimbabwe
's
Wildlife
Department
described
American
conservationists
as
``
fat
little
puppies
from
urban
environments
who
do
n't
know
a
thing
about
Africa
.
''

That
's
not
fair
;
they
're
not
all
fat
.

HUGO'S
BLAST
generates
pleas
for
aid
from
South
Carolina
small
businesses
.

The
Small
Business
Administration
has
received
more
than
5,000
formal
requests
for
disaster
loans
because
of
the
hurricane
.

About
45
%
of
requests
for
SBA
relief
loans
,
which
also
are
available
to
homeowners
,
come
from
small
businesses
,
compared
with
a
25
%
business
share
after
most
disasters
.

The
SBA
expects
to
make
about
$
1
billion
in
Hurricane
Hugo
loans
.

The
disaster
fund
is
replenished
by
loan
repayments
.

Hardest
hit
by
Hugo
in
South
Carolina
were
small
retailers
tied
to
the
tourist
industry
and
businesses
in
agriculture
and
cultivated
seafood
.

The
State
Development
Board
set
up
a
Hugo
Hotline
to
accept
business-to-business
help
.

After
NBC
weather
man
Willard
Scott
broadcast
the
hot-line
number
,
it
was
flooded
with
10,000
calls
.

Last
week
,
the
U.S.
Chamber
of
Commerce
began
using
its
national
TV
show
to
seek
help
,
such
as
equipment
,
for
business
owners
.

Local
bankers
and
accountants
help
applicants
fill
out
forms
.

``
It
helps
us
,
and
people
feel
better
talking
to
someone
who
's
gone
through
the
same
thing
,
''
an
SBA
official
says
.

HEALTH
BENEFITS
remain
a
central
lobbying
effort
,
even
as
Section
89
fades
.

The
Senate
,
after
deleting
Section
89
repeal
from
its
deficit-reduction
bill
,
still
is
expected
to
join
the
House
in
voting
to
kill
the
law
,
which
forces
companies
to
provide
comparable
benefits
to
laborers
and
executives
alike
.

In
lobbying
on
other
health-coverage
topics
,
the
National
Federation
of
Independent
Business
will
press
for
legislation
that
would
give
self-employed
people
a
100
%
tax
deduction
for
their
own
health
plans
,
up
from
25
%
currently
.

And
the
group
will
urge
that
the
federal
government
pre-empt
state
rules
on
what
must
be
covered
by
employers
'
health
insurance
.

Small-business
groups
also
will
fight
the
medical-leave
provision
of
legislation
that
would
expand
parental
leaves
.

And
they
still
oppose
as
too
costly
an
employer-paid
health
insurance
bill
sponsored
by
Sen.
Edward
Kennedy
(
D.
,
Mass
.
)
despite
his
proposal
to
phase
in
small
business
only
gradually
.

There
is
also
worry
that
the
Pepper
Commission
studying
long-term
health
care
will
again
push
lawmakers
toward
employerpaid
solutions
.

The
Section
89
victory
could
have
a
downside
by
making
it
harder
to
oppose
lawmakers
on
other
health
proposals
.

``
With
the
repeal
of
Section
89
,
we
can
no
longer
say
they
're
discouraging
businesses
from
offering
health
plans
,
''
says
Christine
Russell
,
the
Chamber
of
Commerce
's
small-business
advocate
.

JUMPING
THE
GUN
:

Sen.
Lloyd
Bentsen
(
D.
,
Texas
)
was
outraged
after
a
private
word
to
John
Motley
,
lobbyist
for
the
National
Federation
of
Independent
Business
,
resulted
in
a
news
release
saying
that
the
Senate
Finance
Committee
chairman
would
recommend
repeal
of
Section
89
.

Even
though
the
announcement
was
true
in
the
end
,
it
was
issued
without
the
senator
's
permission
.

``
I
blew
it
,
''
Mr.
Motley
says
apologetically
.

``
It
was
a
timing
mistake
.
''

PRISON-SHOP
BLUES
:

Sen.
Strom
Thurmond
(
R.
,
S.C
.
)
protests
pending
legislation
to
end
the
preference
that
the
federal
prison
system
gets
in
selling
prisoner-made
furniture
and
other
goods
to
government
agencies
.

Small-business
suppliers
want
prisons
to
stop
getting
high
priority
,
especially
as
prison
production
grows
with
swelling
inmate
populations
.

Last
year
,
the
prisons
'
sales
to
the
Pentagon
totaled
$
336
million
.

REPAIR
SHOPS
SCRAP
for
more
access
to
work
on
auto-emissions
systems
.

Groups
representing
some
independent
auto-repair
shops
join
a
compromise
on
the
Clean
Air
legislation
worked
out
between
environmentalists
and
Rep.
Henry
Waxman
(
D.
,
Calif
.
)
.

The
plan
would
increase
the
warranty
on
auto-emission
systems
to
eight
years
or
80,000
miles
from
five
years
or
50,000
for
major
parts
.

But
the
warranty
on
simpler
parts
would
be
lowered
to
two
years
or
24,000
miles
.

The
garage
owners
say
they
would
benefit
because
car
owners
would
be
less
likely
to
go
back
to
dealers
for
the
simpler
repairs
after
two
years
.

The
repair
shops
are
n't
united
,
however
.

Shops
represented
by
the
Automotive
Service
Industry
Association
and
the
Motor
Equipment
Manufacturers
Association
oppose
any
increase
in
warranty
length
.

They
say
the
longer
the
warranty
,
the
longer
customers
will
automatically
return
to
new-car
dealers
,
which
then
find
non-warranty
work
that
might
otherwise
go
to
repair
shops
.

The
House
Energy
Committee
will
debate
the
issue
later
this
month
.

Stan
Hathcock
,
an
Atlanta
garage
owner
who
opposes
a
longer
warranty
,
estimates
that
the
current
plan
costs
him
as
much
as
$
15,000
a
year
in
lost
business
.

Mr.

,
Indianapolis
,
when

merged

Moody

Inc.
said
it
lowered

on
about
$
650
million
of
Beatrice
Co.
debt
,
citing
the
closely
held
Chicago
food

The
ratings
concern
said
it
downgraded

from
Ba-3
and
the

's

to

Moody
's
said
the
proposed
recaptilization
may
``
limit
the

's
ability
to
realize
its
profit
potential
''
and
that
paying
dividends
from
a
new
series
of

could
squeeze
``
basic

operations
.
''

A
Beatrice
spokesman
did
n't
return
calls
seeking
comment
.

Beatrice
,
which
went
private
in
an
$
8.2
billion
leveraged
buy-out
in
1986
,
said
last
month
that
it
might
borrow
again
to
help
pay
investors
as
much
as
$
983
million
in
preferred
stock
and
debt
securities

When
the
Soviets
announced
their
last
soldier
had
left
Afghanistan
in
February
,
the
voices
of
skepticism
were
all
but
drowned
out
by
an
international
chorus
of
euphoria
.

It
was
``
the
Soviets
'
Vietnam
.
''

The
Kabul
regime
would
fall
.

Millions
of
refugees
would
rush
home
.

A
resistance
government
would
walk
into
Kabul
.

Those
who
bought
that
illusion
are
now
bewildered
.

Eight
months
after
Gen.
Boris
Gromov
walked
across
the
bridge
into
the
U.S.S.R.
,
a
Soviet-controlled
regime
remains
in
Kabul
,
the
refugees
sit
in
their
camps
,
and
the
restoration
of
Afghan
freedom
seems
as
far
off
as
ever
.

But
there
never
was
a
chance
that
the
Afghan
resistance
would
overthrow
the
Kabul
regime
quickly
and
easily
.

Soviet
leaders
said
they
would
support
their
Kabul
clients
by
all
means
necessary
--
and
did
.

The
U.S.
said
it
would
fully
support
the
resistance
--
and
did
n't
.

With
the
February
1987
U.N.
accords
``
relating
to
Afghanistan
,
''
the
Soviet
Union
got
everything
it
needed
to
consolidate
permanent
control
.

The
terms
of
the
Geneva
accords
leave
Moscow
free
to
provide
its
clients
in
Kabul
with
assistance
of
any
kind
--
including
the
return
of
Soviet
ground
forces
--
while
requiring
the
U.S.
and
Pakistan
to
cut
off
aid
.

The
only
fly
in
the
Soviet
ointment
was
the
last-minute
addition
of
a
unilateral
American
caveat
,
that
U.S.
aid
to
the
resistance
would
continue
as
long
as
Soviet
aid
to
Kabul
did
.

But
as
soon
as
the
accords
were
signed
,
American
officials
sharply
reduced
aid
.

In
February
1989
,
when
the
Soviets
said
they
had
completed
their
pullout
,
the
U.S.
cut
it
further
.

Not
so
the
Soviets
.

Gen.
Gromov
himself
said
Soviet
troops
expected
to
leave
behind
more
than
$
1
billion
of
military
equipment
and
installations
for
the
Kabul
regime
.

Since
the
troop
withdrawal
,
Moscow
has
poured
in
an
additional
$
200
to
$
300
million
worth
per
month
--
nearly
$
2
billion
since
February
,
equivalent
to
the
total
U.S.
aid
to
the
resistance
in
nine
years
.

This
includes
what
Deputy
Foreign
Minister
Yuli
Vorontsov
fetchingly
called
``
new
peaceful
long-range
weapons
,
''
including
more
than
800
SCUD
missiles
.

By
early
May
,
Moscow
had
delivered
,
for
example
,
1,000
trucks
,
about
100
tanks
,
artillery
and
hundreds
of
other
combat
vehicles
.

Later
that
month
,
it
added
an
entire
tank
brigade
,
including
120
T-72
tanks
and
more
than
40
BMP
state-of-the-art
infantry
fighting
vehicles
.

By
September
,
a
new
Reinforced
Motorized
Rifle
Brigade
with
an
additional
300
combat
vehicles
,
1,000
more
trucks
and
10,000
Soviet-trained
Afghan
troops
had
arrived
in
Kandahar
.

In
the
last
few
weeks
,
Moscow
has
added
FROG-7B
missiles
,
the
bomber
version
of
the
An-12
,
MiG-23BN
high-altitude
aircraft
,
MiG-29s
,
which
can
outfly
Pakistan
's
U.S.-built
F16s
,
and
Sukhoi
SU-27
fighter-bombers
,
which
can
outfly
the
MiG-29s
.

Moscow
claims
this
is
all
needed
to
protect
the
Kabul
regime
against
the
guerrilla
resistance
.

It
is
well-known
that
the
regular
Afghan
infantry
is
filled
with
reluctant
conscripts
.

But
this
is
not
the
entire
Afghan
army
,
and
it
is
no
longer
Kabul
's
only
military
force
.

Complete
units
have
been
trained
and
indoctrinated
in
the
U.S.S.R.
and
other
East
bloc
nations
;
30,000
to
40,000
of
these
troops
have
returned
.

In
addition
,
the
regime
has
established
well-paid
paramilitary
forces
totaling
more
than
100,000
,
including
35,000
Soviet-trained
troops
of
the
Interior
Ministry
(
KHAD\/WAD
)
,
which
still
is
directed
by
1,500
Soviet
KGB
officers
.

Even
if
not
all
these
forces
are
committed
to
the
regime
,
they
are
now
dependent
on
it
.

And
thousands
of
Afghan
children
have
been
taken
to
the
Soviet
Union
,
where
they
are
hostage
for
the
behavior
of
their
families
.

Since
1981
,
Indian
military
advisers
have
been
assisting
the
Kabul
regime
.

In
preparation
for
the
withdrawal
,
Moscow
,
Kabul
and
New
Delhi
signed
two
agreements
for
several
hundred
newly
civilian
Indian
experts
to
replace
some
of
the
more
visible
Soviet
military
personnel
.

Cuban
military
personnel
also
have
been
active
in
Afghanistan
since
1979
.

The
Soviets
cut
a
deal
with
Iran
:
a
future
Iranian
role
in
Afghanistan
in
exchange
for
Iranian
support
of
Soviet
policy
.

The
deal
was
symbolized
by
the
restoration
of
the
Shi'ite
Sultan
Ali
Keshtmand
to
the
Afghan
prime
ministry
.

Moreover
,
serious
questions
have
been
raised
about
the
claimed
withdrawal
of
Soviet
forces
.

Before
his
assassination
in
1988
,
President
Zia
of
Pakistan
repeatedly
stated
that
fresh
Soviet
troops
were
being
inserted
into
Afghanistan
even
as
others
were
ostentatiously
withdrawn
.

Rep.
Bill
McCollum
(
R.
,
Fla.
)
reports
that
these
included
20,000
to
30,000
Soviet
Central
Asian
KGB
Border
Guards
,
ethnically
indistinguishable
from
Afghans
and
wearing
unmarked
uniforms
.

Meanwhile
,
the
Kabul
regime
is
increasingly
successful
at
portraying
the
resistance
as
bloody-minded
fanatics
.

In
this
they
are
aided
by
years
of
American
,
European
,
Pakistani
and
Saudi
support
for
the
most
extreme
factions
--
radical
Islamic
fanatics
with
leaders
whose
policies
are
anathema
to
the
Afghan
public
.

This
heavy
outside
support
for
the
worst
has
undermined
better
,
moderate
leaders
.

In
autumn
last
year
,
for
example
,
the
regime
garrison
at
Kandahar
was
prepared
to
surrender
the
city
to
resistance
moderates
.

At
the
last
minute
,
however
,
Pakistani
officials
sent
in
Gulbuddin
Hekhmatyar
,
perhaps
the
most
hated
and
feared
of
the
extremists
,
with
a
demand
that
the
surrender
be
made
to
his
forces
.

The
deal
fell
through
,
and
Kandahar
remains
a
major
regime
base
.

The
resistance
lacks
not
only
air
power
,
armor
and
expertise
but
often
such
essentials
as
maps
,
mine
detectors
,
or
even
winter
gloves
.

Experienced
resistance
commanders
wanted
to
use
guerrilla
action
and
siege
tactics
to
wear
down
the
regime
.

Instead
,
they
were
pressured
by
Pakistan
's
ISI
,
the
channel
for
their
support
,
into
attacking
Jalalabad
.

They
took
more
than
25
%
casualties
;
journalists
report
that
they
faced
minefields
without
mine
detectors
.

The
wonder
is
not
that
the
resistance
has
failed
to
topple
the
Kabul
regime
,
but
that
it
continues
to
exist
and
fight
at
all
.

Last
summer
,
in
response
to
congressional
criticism
,
the
State
Department
and
the
CIA
said
they
had
resumed
military
aid
to
the
resistance
months
after
it
was
cut
off
;
but
it
is
not
clear
how
much
is
being
sent
or
when
it
will
arrive
.

For
months
the
resistance
has
been
defenseless
against
air
attack
.

Thus
far
there
is
no
indication
that
they
have
been
re-supplied
with
Stingers
or
other
anti-aircraft
weapons
.

Indeed
,
U.S.
officials
have
indicated
to
the
press
that
the
continuation
of
aid
depends
on
what
success
the
weakened
resistance
achieves
by
the
end
of
this
year
.

Moscow
and
Kabul
must
have
found
that
information
useful
.

For
a
decade
U.S.
policy
has
been
incoherent
,
based
on
miscalculation
and
the
defense
of
bureaucratic
and
political
turf
.

No
settlement
negotiated
by
others
can
force
the
Afghan
people
to
give
up
their
struggle
.

A
cutoff
of
U.S.
military
aid
would
merely
abandon
them
to
die
in
vain
.

Creation
of
a
new
,
realistic
U.S.
policy
is
long
overdue
.

Nothing
stirred
the
soul
of
Ronald
Reagan
and
his
disciples
as
much
as
the
crusade
to
aid
Nicaragua
's
Contra
rebels
,
or
the
dream
of
building
a
space-based
defense
shield
to
knock
out
Soviet
nuclear
missiles
.

Yet
under
Mr.
Reagan
's
preferred
successor
,
President
Bush
,
those
two
cherished
national-security
causes
are
withering
on
the
vine
.

And
,
surprisingly
,
little
more
than
a
whimper
of
protest
is
being
heard
,
even
though
Reaganauts
once
breathed
fire
supporting
the
Contras
and
the
Strategic
Defense
Initiative
.

``
The
programs
have
arthritis
,
''
says
Rep.
Henry
Hyde
,
a
conservative
Republican
from
Illinois
.

Yet
,
he
asserts
,
``
you
look
around
...
and
you
say
,
`
Who
are
the
leaders
?

Who
is
going
to
carry
the
water
?
'
''

It
is
n't
surprising
that
President
Bush
has
n't
led
a
crusade
to
pump
up
the
Contras
or
SDI
.

Though
he
nominally
supports
both
programs
,
Mr.
Bush
has
n't
been
a
passionate
champion
of
either
cause
,
as
Mr.
Reagan
was
.

What
's
surprising
is
that
there
is
n't
more
of
a
conservative
outcry
as
the
Bush
administration
lets
the
programs
slip
down
the
national-priority
list
.

A
combination
of
factors
--
a
weariness
among
some
conservatives
,
a
decline
in
the
perception
of
a
Soviet
threat
and
a
preoccupation
with
other
issues
--
seem
to
explain
the
strange
tranquility
.

Above
all
,
though
,
conservative
Republicans
who
have
championed
both
the
Contras
and
SDI
are
reluctant
to
attack
a
Republican
president
for
failing
to
do
more
--
though
that
reluctance
may
be
receding
.

``
We
want
to
complain
,
we
want
to
say
something
about
it
,
and
we
're
going
to
as
it
gets
worse
,
''
says
Rep.
Dan
Burton
,
an
Indiana
Republican
who
has
been
a
staunch
Contra
backer
.

``
But
it
's
like
kicking
your
father
in
the
pants
.

You
hate
to
do
it
because
he
's
your
father
.
''

Mr.
Burton
says
conservatives
'
unhappiness
with
Mr.
Bush
's
cautious
handling
of
the
recent
unsuccessful
coup
in
Panama
will
make
them
more
willing
to
speak
out
.

Of
course
,
neither
President
Bush
nor
the
Congress
has
actually
abandoned
the
Contras
or
SDI
.

Mr.
Bush
has
struck
a
deal
with
congressional
leaders
to
provide
nonlethal
aid
to
the
Contras
until
Nicaragua
holds
national
elections
next
February
.

But
the
administration
has
dropped
any
effort
to
win
military
aid
for
the
rebels
.

And
the
administration
's
deal
with
Congress
gives
several
congressional
committees
the
right
to
cut
off
even
humanitarian
aid
next
month
,
though
the
committees
are
likely
to
let
aid
continue
until
February
.

Most
analysts
think
there
's
little
prospect
the
Contras
can
be
a
significant
fighting
force
without
U.S.
arms
,
and
after
the
February
election
their
future
in
any
form
will
be
murky
at
best
.

Instead
of
focusing
on
the
Contras
,
Mr.
Bush
has
switched
to
urging
members
of
Congress
--
most
recently
in
a
White
House
meeting
yesterday
--
to
approve
financing
for
the
election
campaign
of
political
opponents
of
Nicaragua
's
Sandinista
government
.

The
administration
continues
to
support
SDI
,
or
Star
Wars
,
and
it
recently
lobbied
to
persuade
the
Senate
to
restore
some
of
the
funds
it
planned
to
cut
from
the
program
.

And
just
last
week
,
Defense
Secretary
Dick
Cheney
gave
a
strong
speech
listing
``
compelling
reasons
''
to
push
ahead
with
SDI
and
saying
he
'd
urge
President
Bush
to
veto
a
defense
bill
with
``
inadequate
''
funding
for
the
program
.

But
the
strong
pitch
by
Mr.
Cheney
may
be
too
little
too
late
to
prevent
damage
to
SDI
.

The
House
has
already
voted
for
a
deep
cut
in
funding
,
and
in
the
end
the
program
's
backers
will
be
hard
pressed
to
head
off
some
reduction
in
spending
next
year
.

And
while
the
defense
secretary
is
speaking
out
,
President
Bush
himself
has
n't
launched
any
high-visibility
campaign
to
drum
up
support
,
as
President
Reagan
did
.

The
administration
also
acknowledges
that
it
is
n't
pursuing
Mr.
Reagan
's
original
vision
of
an
``
impenetrable
shield
''
protecting
the
whole
U.S.
,
but
rather
a
more
modest
version
.

More
ominous
to
SDI
supporters
,
the
Bush
administration
appears
to
have
tacitly
accepted
a
new
arms-control
proposal
from
the
Soviet
Union
that
spells
long-term
trouble
for
Star
Wars
.

The
Soviets
have
agreed
to
complete
a
treaty
cutting
strategic
weapons
without
including
restrictions
on
space-based
defenses
.

But
the
Soviets
also
are
insisting
that
they
will
reserve
the
right
to
withdraw
from
the
completed
strategic-arms
treaty
later
on
if
the
U.S.
does
SDI
testing
or
deployment
that
the
Soviets
think
violates
the
existing
anti-ballistic-missile
treaty
.

It
will
be
hard
down
the
road
to
persuade
Congress
to
approve
money
for
SDI
plans
if
lawmakers
fear
those
plans
could
scuttle
a
completed
treaty
.

As
a
result
,
Frank
Gaffney
,
a
former
Reagan
Pentagon
aide
who
now
heads
the
Center
for
Security
Policy
,
charges
that
the
administration
's
``
professions
of
continued
commitment
to
development
and
deployment
of
the
SDI
program
strain
credulity
.
''

Still
,
proponents
may
be
shying
away
from
more
drumbeating
because
they
sense
political
tides
have
turned
against
arming
the
Nicaraguan
rebels
or
boosting
spending
on
SDI
--
particularly
when
the
public
perceives
the
Soviet
threat
is
declining
under
Mikhail
Gorbachev
.

In
fact
,
because
communism
seems
to
be
beating
a
global
retreat
,
some
conservatives
may
simply
be
so
pleased
that
their
anti-communist
philosophy
is
prevailing
that
they
do
n't
have
the
fire
at
the
moment
to
push
controversial
programs
.

``
The
short
of
it
is
that
the
most
hard-bitten
among
us
can
not
get
into
too
sour
a
mood
with
communism
collapsing
,
''
says
Mitchell
Daniels
,
a
former
Reagan
White
House
aide
who
now
is
president
of
the
Hudson
Institute
.

Some
activists
are
toiling
to
raise
the
profile
of
the
two
causes
.

But
they
say
they
ca
n't
make
much
headway
because
of
a
lack
of
willing
leaders
in
a
position
to
turn
the
tide
.

One
longtime
champion
of
these
programs
in
Congress
,
Republican
whip
Newt
Gingrich
of
Georgia
,
is
distracted
by
questions
about
his
ethics
,
conservatives
note
.

Other
conservative
champions
,
like
Wyoming
Republican
Sen.
Malcolm
Wallop
,
a
longtime
SDI
advocate
,
do
n't
have
the
clout
with
the
Bush
White
House
that
they
enjoyed
with
President
Reagan
.

Above
all
,
though
,
proponents
say
neither
the
Contra
nor
the
SDI
cause
can
be
pushed
much
further
without
more
presidential
support
.

``
For
there
to
be
wind
in
the
sails
of
any
program
,
the
chief
executive
has
to
be
blowing
in
the
sails
,
''
says
Rep.
Burton
.

All
this
causes
Rep.
Hyde
to
muse
about
an
alternate
way
to
drum
up
more
enthusiasm
.

``
What
I
'd
like
to
see
,
if
he
is
up
to
it
,
is
for
Reagan
to
take
to
the
hustings
to
regenerate
enthusiasm
for
SDI
,
''
the
congressman
says
.

We
're
sorry
to
report
that
on
Monday
President
Bush
accepted
the
resignation
of
William
Allen
as
chairman
of
the
U.S.
Civil
Rights
Commission
.

Mr.
Allen
,
appointed
by
President
Reagan
,
grew
understandably
tired
of
dealing
with
the
guerrilla
tactics
of
his
enemies
.

His
recent
speech
,
provocatively
titled
``
Blacks
?
Animals
?
Homosexuals
?
What
is
a
Minority
?
''
caused
an
uproar
when
its
title
leaked
out
.

Mr.
Allen
's
commissioners
voted
to
call
his
unread
speech
``
thoughtless
,
disgusting
and
unnecessarily
inflammatory
.
''

Commissioner
Mary
Francis
Berry
said
it
was
``
another
sad
episode
in
the
saga
of
the
unguided
missile
who
is
chairman
.
''

Rep.
Don
Edwards
,
the
California
Democrat
,
warned
Mr.
Allen
that
the
speech
would
be
``
outside
the
scope
of
the
commission
's
jurisdiction
.
''

Thomas
Stoddard
,
head
of
the
Lambda
Legal
Defense
Fund
,
called
the
prospect
of
the
speech
``
frankly
shocking
.
''

We
've
actually
read
the
speech
.

Mr.
Allen
began
it
with
a
warning
to
his
hosts
,
a
California
church
group
that
opposes
rights
for
homosexuals
.

He
said
that
other
participants
in
the
conference
``
do
not
believe
that
the
rights
of
Americans
should
be
guaranteed
to
citizens
who
are
homosexual
,
''
but
that
``
I
mean
to
persuade
you
to
the
opposite
view
.
''

He
recalled
to
the
audience
a
``
strange
,
infelicitous
''
analogy
he
once
heard
arguing
``
now
that
we
have
finally
recognized
that
American
blacks
have
rights
,
we
need
to
do
the
same
for
animals
.

''
Mr.
Allen
objected
to
this
analogy
because
it
seems
to
``
assimilate
the
status
of
blacks
to
that
of
animals
--
as
a
mere
project
of
charity
,
of
humaneness
.
''

Rights
on
such
a
basis
,
whether
for
blacks
or
homosexuals
,
are
``
mere
indulgences
,
''
he
said
,
subject
to
being
taken
back
.

He
says
the
title
of
his
speech
was
to
make
his
point
that
Americans
have
rights
as
individuals
,
not
as
members
of
certain
select
groups
.

His
speech
criticized
the
``
idiocy
of
notions
of
protected
groups
in
society
''
as
opposed
to
individual
equality
or
,
as
he
put
it
,
in
``
a
common
destiny
as
Americans
.
''

Instead
of
lobbying
for
special
treatment
,
Mr.
Allen
said
that
homosexuals
and
others
should
try
to
ensure
equal
treatment
under
the
law
and
not
aim
for
special
privileges
that
would
risk
``
invidious
retrenchment
with
government
complicity
.
''

This
hardly
sounds
like
an
anti-homosexual
screed
.

What
's
really
going
on
here
?

The
three
most
important
things
to
understand
about
Mr.
Allen
is
that
he
is
a
black
conservative
intellectual
--
a
triple
threat
to
the
liberal
establishment
.

Mr.
Allen
,
who
teaches
government
at
prestigious
Harvey
Mudd
College
in
California
and
will
remain
a
member
of
the
commission
,
has
spent
years
arguing
that
civil
rights
are
individuals
'
rights
.

He
last
made
waves
when
he
dared
to
defend
an
Indian
girl
who
had
been
adopted
by
non-Indian
parents
off
her
reservation
.

Mr.
Allen
quickly
ran
up
against
the
liberal
establishment
again
,
which
somehow
elevated
the
vague
concept
of
``
Indian
rights
''
above
the
rights
of
individual
Indians
.

There
is
a
huge
divide
between
Mr.
Allen
's
we're-all-in-this-together
view
and
the
divisive
litigation
approach
of
the
civil
rights
groups
.

Indeed
,
the
gap
is
so
large
that
Mr.
Allen
's
critics
refuse
to
engage
the
debate
.

Their
ridicule
of
him
is
no
substitute
for
argument
.

Their
effort
to
run
him
out
of
Washington
is
an
embarrassment
to
the
original
purpose
of
their
own
movement
.

We
hope
the
next
head
of
the
Civil
Rights
Commission
will
be
as
brave
as
Mr.
Allen
in
making
the
case
for
equality
of
civil
rights
.

as
a
director
.

Mr.
LaMore
,
63
,
a
48-year
veteran
at
Bearings
,
has
been
president
since
1983
.

Mr.
Dannemiller
,
51
,
joined
Bearings
in
August
1988
from
Leaseway
Transportation
Corp.
,
where
he
was
president
and
chief
operating
officer
.

He
has
been
a
Bearings
director
since
1985
.

The
appointments
are
part
of
a
planned
succession
at
the
company
.

Soviet
leader
Mikhail
Gorbachev
opened
a
major
U.S.
trade
exhibition
in
Moscow
and
spent
two
hours
touring
some
of
the
150
stalls
representing
such
blue-chip
companies
as
General
Motors
Corp.
,
International
Business
Machines
Corp.
and
Johnson
&
Johnson
.

At
the
Archer-Daniels-Midland
Co.
stand
,
Mrs.
Nelson
Rockefeller
,
a
board
member
,
offered
him
a
soy
burger
.

He
did
n't
bite
.

The
exhibition
by
the
U.S.-U.S.S.R.
Trade
and
Economic
Council
underscores
the
growing
U.S.
interest
in
that
nation
's
market
,
though
trade
between
the
two
countries
is
a
minuscule
$
3
billion
.

The
Soviet
president
and
his
prime
minister
,
Nikolai
Ryzhkov
,
spent
the
longest
time
,
about
15
minutes
,
at
the
IBM
stand
,
where
they
got
souvenir
computer-chip
key
rings
.

At
the
GM
stall
,
they
barely
looked
at
a
gleaming
Cadillac
,
preferring
to
talk
about
cooperation
possibilities
.

In
Beijing
,
meantime
,
China
opened
an
international
aviation
show
,
but
the
West
's
embargo
on
military
deals
and
uncertainty
about
the
nation
's
stability
kept
many
foreign
exhibitors
away
.

Officials
said
91

Japanese
air-conditioner
maker
Daikin
Industries
Ltd.
was
fined
two
million
yen
(
$
14,000
)
for
exporting
to
the
Soviet
Union
a
chemical
solution
that
could
be
used
in
missile-guidance
systems
.

A
Daikin
executive
in
charge
of
exports
when
the
high-purity
halogenated
hydrocarbon
was
sold
to
the
Soviets
in
1986
received
a
suspended
10-month
jail
sentence
.

Judge
Masaaki
Yoneyama
told
the
Osaka
District
Court
Daikin
's
``
responsibility
is
heavy
because
illegal
exports
lowered
international
trust
in
Japan
.
''

Sale
of
the
solution
in
concentrated
form
to
Communist
countries
is
prohibited
by
Japanese
law
and
by
international
agreement
.

A
Soviet
legislative
panel
rejected
as
not
radical
enough
a
government
proposal
on
decentralizing
economic
control
.

The
newspaper
Leninskoye
Zamya
said
the
committee
decided
the
plan
to
parcel
out
economic
powers
previously
exercised
by
Moscow
to
the
country
's
15
republics
``
does
n't
reflect
the
radical
changes
in
the
Soviet
federation
.
''

The
committee
gave
the
government
until
Nov.
15
to
revise
the
proposal
.

The
move
reflected
the
growing
confidence
of
the
revamped
Supreme
Soviet
.

Scott
Paper
Co.
said
it
is
abandoning
a
proposed
$
650
million
tree-farming
project
in
Indonesia
because
it
no
longer
expects
to
use
as
much
eucalyptus
pulp
as
previously
anticipated
.

The
eucalyptus
plantation
and
pulp
mill
,
which
would
have
covered
about
175,000
acres
in
the
Irian
Jaya
region
,
had
been
approved
by
Indonesia
's
investment
board
.

But
it
was
opposed
by
some
environmentalists
as
a
threat
to
Irian
Jaya
's
forests
and
a
potential
source
of
social
unrest
for
the
primitive
tribes
who
inhabit
them
.

Yaohan

of
Japan
is
moving

and
holding

to
Hong
Kong
to
gain
from
the
British
colony
's
economic
advantages
and

.

With

(

,
the
new

,
Yaohan

plans
to

Major

In

The

known
for
its

19th

,
is
providing
``

says
Villa

Antwerp
auctioneer
Campo

Ending
tax-free
shopping
in
the
European
Community
after
1992
could
threaten
more
than
3,000
jobs
,
the
International
Duty
Free
Confederation
said
.

Instead
of
banning
such
shopping
,
the
confederation
proposed
amending
controls
to
be
sure
the
privilege
is
n't
abused

British
and
Argentine
diplomats
opened
talks
in

severed
because
of
their
1982
war
over

Britain

called

Polaroid
Corp.
,
benefiting
from
staff-reduction
savings
,
reported
a
strong
gain
in
third-quarter
operating
results
and
net
income
of
$
29.9
million
,
or
40
cents
a
share
,
after
preferred-stock
requirements
.

Analysts
said
the
numbers
were
better
than
expectations
,
partly
because
of
strong
profit
margins
and
a
positive
foreign-currency
translation
.

However
,
they
said
the
company
's
flat
revenue
was
a
disappointment
,
and
an
indication
that
sales
of
Polaroid
's
new
conventional
film
in
the
U.S.
have
been
sluggish
.

Revenue
in
the
third
quarter
was
$
437.7
million
,
almost
unchanged
from
$
436.3
million
a
year
earlier
.

Polaroid
reported
operating
profit
before
taxes
and
interest
costs
of
$
63.1
million
for
the
third
quarter
,
more
than
double
the
year-before
$
24
million
.

Charges
for
staff
cuts
and
other
restructuring
produced
a
net
loss
of
$
54.1
million
,
or
77
cents
a
share
,
in
1988
's
third
quarter
.

``
I
'm
somewhat
skeptical
about
the
underlying
demand
''
for
Polaroid
products
,
said
Michael
Ellmann
,
an
analyst
with
Wertheim
Schroder
&
Co
.

``
If
you
believe
that
a
good
performance
next
year
is
contingent
on
an
acceleration
of
revenue
,
there
is
n't
a
lot
here
to
base
optimism
on
.
''

Alex
Henderson
,
an
analyst
with
Prudential-Bache
,
says
Polaroid
officials
told
him
yesterday
that
U.S.
sales
of
the
company
's
new
conventional
film
product
,
introduced
in
the
second
quarter
,
have
been
``
disappointing
''
after
a
promising
start
.

Sam
Yanes
,
a
Polaroid
spokesman
,
said
``
I
do
n't
know
about
disappointing
,
''
but
added
that
the
company
has
n't
been
able
to
get
the
product
on
the
shelves
of
some
mass-merchandise
,
discount
retailers
that
it
had
hoped
would
be
carrying
the
product
already
.

Mr.
Yanes
said
the
film
,
One
Film
,
is
currently
carried
at
about
15,000
retail
outlets
,
including
drugstores
and
supermarkets
.

For
the
nine
months
,
Polaroid
reported
earnings
of
$
98.5
million
,
or
$
1.27
a
share
.

Last
year
,
the
company
had
a
nine-month
loss
of
$
15.1
million
,
or
23
cents
a
share
.

In

Why
is
the
stock
market
suddenly
so
volatile
?

Yesterday
,
the
Dow
Jones
Industrial
Average
did
a
now
familiar
dance
:
It
plunged
60.25
points
before
lunch
,
with
most
of
the
drop
occurring
in
25
minutes
.

Then
,
it
rebounded
to
finish
down
only
18.65
points
.

And
those
swings
paled
beside
Friday
's
190.58-point
plunge
and
Monday
's
88.12-point
recovery
.

``
It
's
madness
--
that
in
an
hour
you
can
whack
off
so
much
value
,
''
says
Stanford
Calderwood
,
chairman
of
Trinity
Investment
Management
Corp.
,
Boston
.

And
,
apparently
,
it
is
here
to
stay
.

Richard
Bernstein
,
senior
quantitative
analyst
at
Merrill
Lynch
&
Co
,
says
,
``
My
gut
feel
is
that
we
'll
live
with
those
swings
for
a
while
.
''

There
are
many
reasons
for
the
market
's
jumpiness
:
new
trading
vehicles
such
as
stock-index
futures
and
options
;
computer-driven
strategies
like
program
trading
;
and
crowd
psychology
.

But
most
are
linked
by
a
single
theme
:
liquidity
--
the
ability
to
get
in
and
out
of
the
market
quickly
.

Prices
are
moving
up
and
down
so
fast
because
investors
are
employing
ways
to
turn
over
shares
at
ever-faster
rates
and
increasingly
acting
in
concert
.

``
Institutions
are
herding
animals
,
''
says
Peter
Anderson
,
who
heads
the
pension-fund
management
arm
of
IDS
Financial
Services
Inc
.

``
We
watch
the
same
indicators
and
listen
to
the
same
prognosticators
.

Like
lemmings
,
we
tend
to
move
in
the
same
direction
at
same
time
.
''

And
that
,
naturally
,
exacerbates
price
movements
.

Institutions
--
who
now
account
for
most
trading
--
count
on
being
able
to
buy
and
sell
big
blocks
of
stock
at
an
eye-blink
.

But
when
they
discover
that
markets
are
n't
always
as
liquid
as
they
supposed
--
markets
jump
.

On
Monday
,
for
instance
,
Howard
Ward
,
a
principal
at
Scudder
,
Stevens
&
Clark
,
found
that
``
you
could
n't
buy
blue-chips
at
quoted
prices
without
paying
up
.
''

And
when
many
firms
had
to
``
pay
up
,
''
Monday
's
sudden
rally
was
sparked
.

Trading
in
futures
and
options
,
some
people
believe
,
can
add
to
volatility
.

Investors
believe
they
can
can
rely
on
such
derivative
securities
to
get
in
and
out
of
the
stock
market
without
actually
selling
any
stocks
;
that
is
,
a
way
of
staying
liquid
even
when
they
own
stocks
.

These
and
other
modern
trading
methods
``
tend
to
promote
dramatic
shifts
in
assets
,
''
says
George
Douglas
,
first
vice
president
at
Drexel
Burnham
Lambert
Inc
.

``
It
's
the
idea
that
what
goes
in
easy
can
come
out
easy
''
--
so
that
bouts
of
higher
volatility
get
built
into
the
stock
market
.

One
new
investment
style
called
``
asset
allocation
''
shifts
portfolio
weightings
between
stocks
,
bonds
and
cash
when
computer
models
say
one
is
more
attractive
.

For
instance
,
First
Quadrant
Corp.
,
an
asset
allocator
based
in
Morristown
,
N.J.
,
said
it
quickly
boosted
stock
positions
in
its
``
aggressive
''
accounts
to
75
%
from
55
%
to
take
advantage
of
plunging
prices
Friday
.

It
added
another
5
%
Monday
before
stocks
rallied
.

When
they
did
,
the
firm
reduced
those
stock
holdings
to
about
70
%
.

A
classic
example
of
institutions
'
hunger
for
liquidity
is
portfolio
insurance
,
now
widely
discredited
.

Before
the
1987
crash
,
an
estimated
$
60
billion
in
institutional
money
was
managed
under
this
hedging
technique
.

The
idea
was
to
``
insure
''
the
value
of
a
portfolio
by
selling
futures
when
stock
prices
dropped
--
eliminating
the
need
to
sell
the
stocks
themselves
.

But
in
October
1987
,
when
portfolio
insurers
rushed
to
sell
at
the
same
time
,
they
overwhelmed
both
the
stock
and
futures
markets
.

Yet
even
today
,
institutions
are
quietly
practicing
forms
of
portfolio
insurance
by
nervously
rushing
to
and
fro
in
the
markets
.

Others
are
doing
``
index
arbitrage
''
a
strategy
of
taking
advantage
of
price
discrepancies
between
stocks
and
futures
.

Unlike
traditional
buy-and-hold
strategies
,
all
of
the
above
require
that
market
makers
be
on
hand
to
provide
liquidity
by
buying
and
selling
stocks
in
a
crunch
.

But
institutions
say
Wall
Street
brokerage
firms
are
less
willing
to
make
markets
.

Brokers
do
n't
deny
that
.

Wall
Street
traders
say
that
,
with
institutional
brokerage
commissions
far
lower
than
in
the
1970s
,
securities
firms
ca
n't
afford
to
take
the
risk
of
buying
too
much
stock
.

``
I
think
everyone
's
a
little
more
leery
,
''
says
Jack
Baker
,
head
of
equity
trading
at
Shearon
Lehman
Hutton
Inc
.

``
The
institutions
have
driven
(
commission
)
rates
down
to
the
point
where
it
makes
no
sense
to
commit
capital
,
''
says
Tom
Gallagher
,
senior
executive
vice
president
in
charge
of
institutional
trading
at
Oppenheimer
&
Co
.

``
Why
should
I
risk
money
for
a
guy
for
who
's
paying
me
five
cents
a
dance
?

All
you
get
is
risk
.
''

Lack
of
liquidity
can
also
result
from
exchange
``
reforms
.
''

Many
traders
say
that
``
circuit
breakers
''
put
in
place
to
damp
volatility
after
the
1987
crash
actually
added
to
volatility
when
the
stock
market
plunged
Friday
.

The
circuit
breakers
caused
a
30-minute
shutdown
in
trading
in
Standard
&
Poor
's
500-stock
index
futures
contract
as
the
markets
were
falling
.

``
With
the
futures-trading
halt
,
you
could
only
sell
stocks
''
to
cut
exposure
to
the
market
,
says
a
money
manager
.

``
It
was
scary
to
people
thinking
that
they
could
n't
get
their
trades
off
.
''

``
It
was
like
they
put
you
in
a
room
with
a
gorilla
and
told
you
there
were
three
doors
to
exit
,
''
said
one
Chicago-based
futures
trader
.

``
Then
they
said
,
`
By
the
way
,
two
of
the
doors
are
locked
.
'
''

The
takeover
mania
also
adds
to
volatility
.

UAL
Corp.
is
a
good
example
.

Valued
as
a
buy-out
target
,
the
airline
stock
was
trading
at
nearly
$
280
a
share
.

When
the
deal
ran
into
trouble
,
the
stock
tumbled
;
it
closed
at
$
198
yesterday
.

Presumably
,
UAL
is
now
trading
closer
to
its
value
based
on
earnings
.

By
contrast
,
traditional
buy-and-hold
investors
are
unlikely
to
generate
sudden
price
moves
.

Scott
Black
,
a
value-oriented
money
manager
who
heads
Delphi
Management
Inc.
,
points
out
that
for
those
who
invest
on
fundamentals
,
``
the
value
of
a
stock
from
day
to
day
does
n't
change
all
that
much
.
''

Some
experts
say
markets
are
n't
as
volatile
as
widely
assumed
.

Hans
Stoll
,
finance
professor
at
Vanderbilt
University
,
says
the
current
volatility
in
U.S.
markets
pales
in
comparison
to
the
1930s
,
decades
before
derivative
instruments
such
as
options
and
futures
were
introduced
.

``
I
just
ca
n't
believe
that
the
innovations
in
the
financial
market
are
causing
any
of
this
volatility
,
''
he
says
.

And
Robert
D.
Arnott
,
president
of
asset
allocator
First
Quadrant
,
notes
that
before
Friday
's
tailspin
,
daily
volatility
on
the
New
York
Stock
Exchange
in
recent
weeks
had
reached
``
historically
low
levels
.
''

Some
people
tend
to
ignore
that
a
50-point
move
is
less
in
percentage
terms
than
it
was
when
the
stock
market
was
lower
.

John
J.
Phelan
Jr.
,
chairman
of
the
Big
Board
,
asserts
that
``
1988
and
1989
have
been
two
of
the
least
volatile
years
in
the
last
30
or
40
years
.
''

But
the
low
average
volatility
Mr.
Phelan
is
talking
about
is
n't
any
comfort
in
a
period
of
rapid
stock-market
moves
like
the
past
week
.

In
addition
,
Sanford
Grossman
,
a
Wharton
School
finance
professor
,
says
volatile
jumps
in
stock
prices
will
continue
as
long
as
liquidity
falls
short
of
the
voracious
demands
of
institutions
``
who
can
go
out
and
say
`
I
have
a
billion
dollars
of
stocks
to
sell
.
'
''

Some
people
think
the
search
for
liquidity
is
fruitless
.

In
1936
,
John
Maynard
Keynes
wrote
that
``
of
the
maxims
of
orthodox
finance
none
,
surely
,
is
more
antisocial
than
the
fetish
of
liquidity
.
''

It
leads
investors
to
focus
on
short-term
price
movements
--
``
a
game
of
musical
chairs
,
''
he
called
it
--
rather
than
on
long-term
fundamental
valuation
.

The
National
Aeronautics
and
Space
Administration
said
a
computer
virus
has
infected
one
of
its
networks
and
is
spreading
anti-nuclear
messages
related
to
its
Galileo
space
probe
,
which
is
to
be
launched
today
.

Charles
Redmond
,
a
NASA
spokesman
,
said
the
agency
discovered
the
virus
on
Monday
on
the
collection
of
computer
networks
collectively
called
Internet
and
expected
100
university
centers
to
be
infected
by
today
.

Although
the
network
is
n't
connected
to
the
computer
systems
that
operate
either
Galileo
or
the
shuttle
,
part
of
the
network
will
carry
analyses
of
Galileo
data
once
the
craft
gets
spaceborn
.

Mr.
Redmond
said
the
intruder
had
n't
yet
done
any
harm
but
the
agency
feared
``
garbage
data
could
be
substituted
for
real
data
.
''

He
estimated
it
could
take
a
day
for
a
computer
security
manager
to
expunge
the
virus
from
a
computer
system
.

The
intruder
,
among
the
broadest
yet
to
hit
a
research
network
,
appeared
to
affect
only
Digital
Equipment
Corp.
hardware
that
uses
Digital
's
VAX\/VMS
operating
system
.

It
is
unrelated
to
the
much-publicized
virus
that
last
year
infected
Arpanet
,
a
much
larger
network
used
by
researchers
at
universities
,
laboratories
and
government
agencies
around
the
world
.

In
the
lingo
of
computer
security
,
the
NASA
intruder
is
technically
a
computer
worm
,
Mr.
Redmond
said
.

A
worm
resides
in
the
operating
system
of
a
computer
and
spreads
by
boring
into
other
computers
contacted
through
networks
.

The
Galileo
worm
apparently
was
hatched
on
a
computer
in
France
hooked
up
to
NASA
's
Space
Physics
Analysis
Network
,
Mr.
Redmond
said
.

NASA
said
the
Galileo
worm
had
n't
affected
its
computers
or
the
computers
of
other
government
agencies
because
they
had
modified
their
systems
to
reject
worms
.

But
Mr.
Redmond
said
the
worm
hit
universities
that
had
n't
elected
to
make
the
changes
.

Michael
Alexander
,
a
senior
editor
at
Computerworld
,
a
trade
publication
,
said
he
was
told
that
the
worm
gets
into
a
computer
center
by
looking
for
obvious
passwords
--
such
as
ones
that
are
the
same
as
the
user
's
name
.

If
it
finds
one
and
gets
into
the
system
,
it
will
display
a
screen
when
a
user
logs
on
that
says
,
``
Worms
Against
Nuclear
Killers
...
.

You
talk
of
times
of
peace
for
all
,
and
then
prepare
for
war
.
''

In
addition
,
Mr.
Alexander
said
,
the
worm
sends
strange
messages
to
other
machines
at
the
center
--
such
as
,
``
George
Orwell
was
an
optimist
,
''
or
``
Do
n't
feed
the
bats
tonight
.
''

The
worm
also
looks
for
elementary
passwords
that
confer
more
privileges
on
the
user
.

The
passwords
are
included
in
the
system
software
when
it
is
installed
but
are
supposed
to
be
replaced
as
soon
as
the
system
is
up
and
running
.

If
it
finds
one
of
those
passwords
,
Mr.
Alexander
said
,
the
worm
will
do
such
things
as
change
users
'
passwords
to
a
series
of
random
numbers
,
preventing
them
from
signing
on
to
the
network
.

NASA
estimated
that
,
on
Monday
,
about
four
computer
centers
were
affected
.

Yesterday
,
the
number
grew
to
40
;
today
the
number
is
expected
to
grow
to
100
.

NASA
said
it
will
take
about
a
week
before
it
knows
exactly
how
many
centers
of
the
6,000
connected
to
Internet
were
affected
and
the
extent
of
the
damage
,
if
any
.

Anti-nuclear
activists
have
protested
the
launch
of
the
Galileo
space
probe
to
Jupiter
because
it
uses
plutonium
to
generate
the
electricity
needed
to
run
the
craft
.

Activists
fear
that
if
the
shuttle
carrying
Galileo
into
orbit
should
explode
,
or
if
Galileo
itself
crashes
into
the
Earth
during
the
two
times
it
flies
close
to
the
planet
,
fatal
levels
of
plutonium
would
be
released
into
the
atmosphere
.

So
far
Galileo
has
been
delayed
twice
,
once
because
of
a
computer
malfunction
connected
with
a
space-shuttle
engine
,
and
yesterday
because
of
the
weather
.

NASA
said
the
Galileo
worm
had
nothing
to
do
with
either
delay
.

Mr.
Alexander
of
Computerworld
said
hackers
have
gone
after
SPAN
before
.

He
said
the
Chaos
Computer
Club
,
of
West
Germany
,
once
managed
to
invade
SPAN
and
do
such
things
as
change
the
value
of
pi
,
messing
up
some
calculations
.

It
is
now
a
commonplace
that
prosecutors
are
bringing
criminal
indictments
in
cases
where
until
a
few
years
ago
only
a
civil
action
at
most
would
have
been
brought
.

Yet
it
is
also
axiomatic
that
the
power
to
create
new
crimes
belongs
only
to
the
legislature
,
and
not
to
courts
.

Beginning
in
the
early
19th
century
,
with
U.S.
v.
Hudson
and
Goodwin
,
the
Supreme
Court
has
repeatedly
held
that
a
judicial
power
to
declare
conduct
to
be
against
the
public
interest
and
hence
criminal
,
while
well
established
in
British
law
,
would
usurp
legislative
authority
under
the
doctrine
of
separation
of
powers
.

That
's
the
conventional
theory
anyway
.

In
practice
,
however
,
the
line
between
interpretation
and
redefinition
of
the
criminal
law
long
ago
began
to
blur
.

In
particular
,
a
common
law
of
white-collar
crime
has
developed
with
surprising
rapidity
over
the
past
decade
.

For
example
,
although
insider
trading
has
long
been
criminal
,
it
has
never
been
statutorily
defined
.

In
1983
,
the
Supreme
Court
tried
to
supply
a
workable
definition
in
the
Dirks
v.
SEC
decision
,
which
found
that
liability
depended
on
whether
the
tipper
had
breached
his
fiduciary
duty
to
the
corporation
in
order
to
obtain
``
some
personal
gain
''
and
whether
the
tippee
knew
or
recklessly
disregarded
this
fact
.

Gradually
,
however
,
lower
courts
and
prosecutors
have
pushed
this
definition
to
its
breaking
point
.

Consider
the
facts
underlying
the
1989
conviction
of
Robert
Chestman
.

Prior
to
a
tender
offer
by
A&P
for
Waldbaum
Inc.
in
1986
,
the
founder
of
the
Waldbaum
's
supermarket
chain
called
an
elderly
relative
to
tell
her
to
assemble
her
stock
certificates
for
delivery
.

She
called
her
daughter
to
take
her
to
the
bank
,
who
,
in
turn
,
persuaded
her
husband
,
a
Mr.
Loeb
,
to
run
this
errand
.

Hearing
of
this
information
,
the
husband
discussed
it
with
his
broker
,
Mr.
Chestman
,
and
Mr.
Chestman
then
bought
for
his
own
account
and
other
clients
.

Basically
,
Mr.
Chestman
was
a
fourth-level
tippee
.

Did
Mr.
Loeb
,
his
tipper
,
breach
a
fiduciary
duty
(
and
,
if
so
,
to
whom
)
?

Did
Mr.
Loeb
seek
personal
gain
(
and
if
so
,
how
)
?

Or
did
Mr.
Chestman
only
hear
a
market
rumor
(
which
one
may
lawfully
trade
upon
)
?

The
line
seems
awfully
thin
for
criminal-law
purposes
.

A
second
illustration
is
supplied
by
the
recent
guilty
plea
entered
by
Robert
Freeman
,
formerly
head
of
arbitrage
at
Goldman
,
Sachs
&
Co
.

Essentially
,
Mr.
Freeman
had
invested
heavily
in
the
Beatrice
leveraged
buy-out
,
when
he
was
told
by
another
prominent
trader
,
Bernard
``
Bunny
''
Lasker
,
that
the
deal
was
in
trouble
.

After
placing
orders
to
sell
,
Mr.
Freeman
called
Martin
Siegel
,
an
investment
banker
at
Kidder
,
Peabody
&
Co.
,
who
was
advising
on
the
deal
,
to
confirm
these
rumors
.

Mr.
Siegel
asked
Mr.
Freeman
who
his
source
was
and
,
on
hearing
that
it
was
Bunny
Lasker
,
responded
:
``
Well
,
your
bunny
has
a
good
nose
.
''

The
illegal
``
tip
''
of
the
bunny
's
good
nose
was
then
largely
a
confirmation
of
rumors
already
known
to
many
in
the
market
.

Had
the
case
gone
to
trial
the
same
issues
would
have
surfaced
:

Was
there
a
fiduciary
breach
in
order
to
obtain
personal
gain
?

Did
Mr.
Freeman
have
notice
of
this
?

Finally
,
was
the
information
material
?

Yet
,
all
these
issues
are
subsidiary
to
a
more
central
issue
:
Who
is
and
who
should
be
making
the
criminal
law
here
?

It
is
not
my
contention
that
either
Mr.
Chestman
or
Mr.
Freeman
was
an
innocent
victim
of
prosecutorial
overzealousness
.

Arguably
,
both
were
on
notice
that
their
behavior
was
at
least
risky
.

But
even
if
they
behaved
recklessly
,
reasons
still
exist
to
fear
and
resist
this
steady
process
of
case-by-case
judicial
extension
of
the
law
of
insider
trading
.

Courts
and
legislatures
make
decisions
in
very
different
ways
and
are
each
susceptible
to
very
different
kinds
of
errors
.

After-the-fact
judicial
examination
of
an
actor
's
conduct
has
always
been
the
common
law
's
method
.

When
only
civil
liability
is
involved
,
this
method
has
the
undeniable
strengths
of
factual
specificity
and
avoidance
of
overgeneralization
.

Still
,
case-by-case
retrospective
decision
making
of
this
sort
is
vulnerable
to
the
tunnel
vision
caused
by
a
fixation
on
ad
hoc
(
and
usually
sleazy
)
examples
.

When
a
court
decides
that
a
particular
actor
's
conduct
was
culpable
and
so
extends
the
definition
of
insider
trading
to
reach
this
conduct
,
it
does
not
see
the
potentially
enormous
number
of
other
cases
that
will
be
covered
by
the
expanded
rule
.

Thus
,
a
court
is
poorly
positioned
to
make
judgments
about
the
social
utility
of
the
expanded
rule
.

For
example
,
in
focusing
on
Mr.
Freeman
's
attempt
to
gain
nonpublic
information
about
a
deal
's
collapse
,
one
does
not
naturally
think
about
the
reverse
side
of
the
coin
:
What
if
the
rumor
had
been
false
?

Can
a
security
analyst
call
an
investment
banker
to
make
certain
that
a
seemingly
improbable
rumor
is
in
fact
false
?

In
the
past
,
not
only
would
reputable
professionals
have
rushed
to
check
out
such
rumors
with
the
company
,
but
companies
listed
on
the
major
stock
exchanges
were
encouraged
by
the
exchanges
to
respond
openly
to
such
inquiries
from
securities
analysts
.

Today
,
after
Mr.
Freeman
's
plea
,
there
is
an
uncertainty
that
is
both
unfair
and
inefficient
.

In
this
light
,
the
comparative
advantages
of
legislative
law-making
become
clear
:
(
1
)
Before
it
acts
,
the
legislature
typically
will
hear
the
views
of
representatives
of
all
those
affected
by
its
decision
,
not
just
the
immediate
parties
before
the
court
;
and
(
2
)
the
legislature
can
frame
``
bright
line
''
standards
that
create
less
uncertainty
than
the
fact-bound
decisions
of
courts
.

Although
legislative
lines
can
result
in
under-inclusion
(
which
explains
why
the
SEC
has
long
resisted
a
legislative
definition
of
insider
trading
)
,
judicial
lawmaking
inevitably
creates
uncertainty
because
of
the
shadowy
outer
edges
and
implications
of
most
judicial
decisions
.

At
least
when
the
stakes
are
high
,
uncertainty
in
turn
results
in
overinclusion
,
as
individuals
do
not
dare
to
approach
an
uncertain
line
closely
.

The
federal
mail
and
wire
fraud
statutes
provide
even
better
illustrations
of
the
rapid
evolution
of
a
federal
common
law
of
white-collar
crime
.

In
1987
,
the
Supreme
Court
attempted
in
McNally
v.
U.S.
to
halt
the
inexorable
expansion
of
these
statutes
by
adopting
a
rule
of
strict
construction
for
ambiguous
criminal
statues
.

Yet
,
late
last
year
,
Congress
effectively
reversed
this
decision
by
enacting
a
one-sentence
statute
that
defined
fraud
to
include
any
scheme
to
deprive
another
of
``
the
intangible
right
of
honest
services
.
''

At
a
stroke
,
this
may
criminalize
all
fiduciary
breaches
(
and
possibly
all
misrepresentations
by
an
agent
or
employee
)
.

Such
a
statute
illustrates
the
fundamental
problem
:
Congress
finds
it
is
easier
to
pass
sweepingly
moralistic
prohibitions
,
which
the
courts
must
thereafter
interpret
,
than
to
engage
in
the
difficult
line-drawing
distinctions
that
are
inherently
its
responsibility
.

We
are
confronted
less
with
a
judicial
power
grab
than
with
a
legislative
giveaway
.

Predictably
,
when
confronted
with
morally
dubious
behavior
,
prosecutors
will
exploit
the
latitude
such
openended
statutes
give
them
.

Over
the
long
run
,
however
,
sleazy
cases
will
make
bad
law
.

Industrial
Average
plunged
nearly
27
points
to
a
60.25-point
deficit
.

Computer-guided
buying
then
kicked
in
,
and
the
industrials
regained
27
points
in
five
minutes
.

The
lightning
moves
show
that
the
stock
market
remains
fragile
and
volatile
--
ready
to
jump
at
the
slightest
rumor
--
a
few
days
after
its
shocking
190.58-point
plunge
.

Nervous
investors
continued
to
limit
their
buying
to
blue-chip
stocks
while
dumping
takeover-related
issues
.

The
industrial
average
closed
down
18.65

to

New

The
stock
tumbled
24

on
volume
of
2.8
million

.

The
market
is
still
very
touchy
about
rumors
and
news
on
pending
takeovers
.

UAL
,
which
is
trying
to
reconstruct
a
buy-out
bid
that
banks
would
n't
finance
,
represents
the
future
of
one
of
the
most
powerful
ingredients
in
the
bull
market
-
corporate
restructuring
.

An
important
element
of
this
phenomenon
--
the
now-shaky
market
for
junk
bonds
,
used
often
to
finance
restructurings
and
takeovers
--
continued
to
cast
a
pall
over
stocks
.

The
volatility
wo
n't
end
soon

This
Friday
brings
the
``
double
witching
hour
,
''
Wall
Street
's
nickname
for
the
monthly
simultaneous
expiration
of
a
variety
of
stock
index
futures
,
index
options
and
options
on
individual

.

Traders
are
already
buckling
their
seat
belts
.

Previous
monthly
expirations
of
the
Major
Market
Index
futures
and
Standard
&
Poor
's
100-stock
index
options
have
produced
spectacular
volatility
.

``
We
are
in
one
of
those
phases
where
you
are
going

get
a

of

said
Donald
Selkin
,
head
of
stock-index
research
at
Prudential-Bache
Securities
.

Investors
were
buying
yesterday
,
but
they
were
running
scared
to
premier
blue
chips
such
as
Procter

Gamble
,
which
jumped
3
3\/8

Investors
``
are
buying
stocks
that
have
predictable
earnings
,
''
said
Edward
J.
Laux
,
head
of
block
trading
at
Kidder
Peabody
.

Along
the
way
,
investors
dumped
takeover
stocks
and
shares
of
banks
that
have
leveraged-buy-out
debt
and
risky
real
estate
loans
on
their
books
.

``
These
loans
are
more
of
a
focus
than
lesser-developed-country
debt
now

William
Bee
,
senior
block
trader
at

yesterday
.

In
the

,
about
one

a

changed

In

,
traders
buy

ahead

Aside

computer-guided

,
airline

took
a
beating
as
well
.

The

ONE
LIBERTY

declared
a
dividend
of

cents
a

on
its
$
16.50
cumulative
convertible
preferred
stock
,
payable
Jan.

Dec.

But
directors
of
the
Great

N.Y.
,
real

trust
did
n't
act
on
the
common
stock
dividend

And
they
wo

consider
such
a
dividend
,
the
trust
added
,
before
results
are
available
for
the
first
quarter
of
1990
.

In
part
,
the
trust
cited
the
need
to
retain
cash
for
possible
acquisitions
.

According
to
a

One

Banks
are
continuing
to
go
after
individual
investors
,
despite
falling
interest
rates
.

Yields
on
small-denomination
certificates
of
deposit
fell
at
about
half
the
rate
of
so-called
jumbo
CDs
this
week
,
according
to
Banxquote
Money
Markets
,
an
information
service
based
here
.

Investors
can
get
slightly
higher
yields
on
deposits
below
$
50,000
than
they
can
on
deposits
of
$
90,000
and
up
.

``
Banks
want
to
remain
competitive
,
''
said
Norberto
Mehl
,
chairman
of
Banxquote

``
October
is
a
big
rollover
month
and
perhaps
they
anticipate
greater
demand
...
among
people
leaving
the

''

Some
bankers
are
reporting
more
inquiries
than
usual
about
CDs
since
Friday
.

``
Reports
from
branches
are
that
there
has
been

the

day

so
,
''
said
Steven
Braitman
,
a
vice
president
at
Chemical
Bank
in
New

.

Chemical
said
deposits
Monday
were
about
$
5
million
higher
than
usual
and
it
expects
more
activity
as
investors
receive
the
proceeds
from

``
This

the
Dow

,
''
proclaimed
an
advertisement
Monday
in
New
York
newspapers
,
touting
Lincoln
Savings
Bank
's
one-year
CD
.

Harold
Jones
,
Lincoln
's
chief
retail
banking
officer
,
said
there
has
n't
yet
been
``
a
discernible
response
,
''
although
the
ad
included
a
coupon
that
could
arrive
later
in
the
week
.

Friday
's
market
rout
came
smack
in
the
middle
of
the
heaviest
month
for
CD
rollovers
,
when
a
number
of
banks
and
thrifts
already
have
promotions
under
way
.

First
National
Bank
of
Boston
,
for
example
,
is
offering
certain
new
depositors
an
extra
quarter
of
a
percentage
point
on
six-month
and
12-month
CDs
.

Some
banks
actually
boosted
yields
on
the
shortest
term
CDs
in
the
latest
week
.

New
York
's
Citibank
,
for
instance
,
increased
the
yield
on
small-denomination
three-month
CDs
to
8
%
from
7.9
%
.

On
average
,
however
,
three-month
CDs
at
major
banks
are
yielding
a
tenth
of
a
percentage
point
less
than
they
were
a
week
ago
.

Average
yields
on
CDs
aimed
at
individual
investors
fell
less
than
half
as
much
as
yields
on
Treasury
bills
sold
at
Monday
's
auction
.

Six-month
CDs
of
$
50,000
and
less
yielded
an
average
8.02
%
in
the
week
ended
Tuesday
,
down
from
8.10
%
,
according
to
Banxquote
.

The
yield
on
six-month
T-bills
fell
to
7.82
%
on
Monday
,
from
8.01
%
the
week
before
.

Meanwhile
,
the
average
yield
on
six-month
CDs
of
more
than
$
90,000
fell
to
7.93
%
in
the
latest
week
,
according
to
Banxquote
,
from
8.10
%
the
week
before
.

Mr.
Mehl
noted
that
actual
rates
are
almost
identical
on
small
and
large-denomination
CDs
,
but
yields
on
CDs
aimed
at
the
individual
investor
are
boosted
by
more
frequent
compounding
.

CDs
sold
by
major
brokerage
houses
,
which
like
jumbo
CDs
tend
to
closely
follow
interest
rate
trends
,
also
posted
larger
drops
in
yields
.

A
six-month
,
broker-sold
CD
,
for
example
,
was
yielding
an
average
8.09
%
in
the
latest
week
,
a
fifth
of
a
percentage
point
lower
than
the
week
before
.

In
late
April
,
when
interest
rates
were
at
their
recent
highs
,
short-term
CDs
sold
by
brokers
were
offering
yields
half
a
percentage
point
or
more
higher
than
banks
.

CD
yields
are
generally
expected
to
fall
further
in
coming
weeks
.

``
What
happened
in
the
stock
market
and
the
bigger
trade
deficit
''
reported
yesterday
``
make
it
unlikely
that
short-term
interest
rates
will
rise
''
any
time
soon
,
said
Mr.
Mehl
of
Banxquote
.

``
Even
before
the
market
drop
,
rates
were
down
about
half
a
percentage
point
,
''
said
Robert
J.
Hutchinson
,
senior
vice
president
for
retail
marketing
at
Manufacturers
Hanover
Trust
Co.
in
New
York
.

``
That
puts
pressure
on
CD
rates
.

Conservatives
have
an
important
decision
to
make
this
fall
.

At
the
recent
meetings
of
the
World
Bank
and
International
Monetary
Fund
,
the
Bush
administration
announced
its
intention
to
decide
by
yearend
the
size
of
the
next
increase
in
the
IMF
's
capital
base
.

While
the
U.S.
share
of
the
increase
probably
will
not
reach
the
$
12
billion
or
more
implicit
in
the
IMF
's
request
for
a
doubling
of
its
$
90
billion
capital
,
the
administration
probably
will
agree
to
a
multibillion-dollar
increase
.

This
would
be
consistent
with
its
unwavering
support
for
the
Brady
Plan
and
G-7
exchange-rate
intervention
,
and
with
its
financial
commitment
to
Mexico
,
Poland
and
others
.

The
IMF
has
several
reasons
for
requesting
the
increase
.

Its
role
in
the
economies
of
developing
countries
has
grown
steadily
since
the
1970s
.

The
size
and
pace
of
disbursements
will
accelerate
further
under
the
Brady
Plan
,
which
promises
larger
and
earlier
disbursements
to
approved
countries
.

At
least
three
other
factors
have
encouraged
the
IMF
to
insist
on
increased
capital
.

First
,
it
argues
that
its
capital
base
must
be
increased
in
order
to
maintain
its
size
relative
to
world
financial
markets
,
for
which
it
feels
some
responsibility
.

Second
,
the
World
Bank
's
recent
$
75
billion
capital
increase
--
$
14
billion
from
the
U.S.
--
has
left
the
IMF
feeling
less
than
first
fiddle
among
international
financial
institutions
.

Third
,
the
IMF
would
like
to
meet
Japan
's
request
for
increased
ownership
(
currently
4.5
%
)
.

Japan
has
supported
a
larger
role
for
the
IMF
in
developing-country
debt
issues
,
and
is
an
important
financial
resource
for
IMF-guided
programs
in
developing
countries
.

While
international
politics
may
argue
for
the
capital
increase
,
there
is
a
clear
economic
case
against
it
.

Opponents
of
the
increase
argue
that
the
IMF
practices
central
planning
while
supporting
ineffective
governments
.

They
question
whether
the
IMF
has
any
role
in
developing
countries
,
given
its
original
mandate
to
assist
industrial
countries
in
balance-of-payments
emergencies
.

Opponents
show
that
there
are
already
more
funds
available
than
commendable
reform
efforts
.

They
worry
that
new
IMF
funding
of
developing
countries
will
simply
end
up
substituting
IMF
debt
for
reschedulable
commercial
bank
debt
,
a
bad
trade
all
around
.

They
believe
microeconomics
,
which
addresses
the
problems
of
markets
,
investment
climate
and
management
practices
,
is
the
key
to
developing-country
growth
,
not
the
IMF
's
Keynesian
focus
on
trade
deficits
,
quarterly
targets
and
government
debt
.

They
point
at
the
numerous
developing-country
governments
that
have
inflated
,
taxed
and
regulated
themselves
into
despair
under
successive
IMF
programs
.

Decisions
on
increases
in
the
IMF
's
capital
base
traditionally
are
made
by
the
administration
,
with
subsequent
authorization
by
Congress
.

The
last
U.S.
congressional
authorization
,
in
1983
,
was
a
political
donnybrook
and
carried
a
$
6
billion
housing
program
along
with
it
to
secure
adequate
votes
.

The
politics
of
the
1990
congressional
authorization
are
likely
to
be
similar
to
those
of
previous
authorizations
.

Liberals
may
support
the
stabilizing
,
quasi-governmental
role
of
the
IMF
on
two
conditions
:
that
the
administration
give
assurances
that
liberal
Democrats
'
support
will
not
be
used
against
them
in
congressional
re-election
campaigns
;
and
that
the
legislation
address
--
with
dollars
--
social
and
environmental
concerns
.

Conservative
Republicans
will
be
given
the
choice
of
supporting
or
fighting
their
party
's
popular
president
in
an
election
year
.

A
U.S.
decision
to
refuse
the
IMF
its
capital
increase
,
or
limit
it
to
25
%
,
would
bring
a
major
change
in
international
economic
policy
,
and
could
not
be
taken
lightly
.

Commentators
would
fret
over
the
implications
for
the
G-7
coordination
process
and
the
stability
of
world
financial
markets
.

Because
commercial
banks
and
the
developing-country
governments
believe
they
will
get
a
piece
of
any
capital
increase
,
a
scaled-down
IMF
mission
would
leave
both
feeling
shortchanged
.

Furthermore
,
a
U.S.
rejection
of
the
capital
increase
(
and
transfer
of
shares
to
Japan
)
would
give
Japan
an
argument
against
future
calls
for
economic
burden-sharing
.

On
the
other
hand
,
a
decision
to
increase
the
IMF
's
capital
would
reinforce
the
central
economic
role
of
multilateral
institutions
in
developing
countries
.

With
the
increase
,
even
more
developing-country
energy
and
talent
would
be
diverted
from
creating
profitable
economic
systems
to
setting
up
economic
planning
ministries
that
generate
IMF-approved
economic
plans
.

Upping
the
ante
could
slow
economic
development
even
further
,
as
countries
delay
market-opening
steps
in
anticipation
of
richer
multilateral
support
.

Conservatives
should
take
a
position
prior
to
the
administration
's
year-end
deadline
.

The
issues
are
too
important
to
be
left
to
the
financial
and
budget
ministries
fighting
over
the
size
of
the
capital
increase
,
rather
than
its
purpose
.

If
conservatives
do
n't
support
an
increase
in
the
IMF
's
capital
,
then
it
is
incumbent
on
them
to
speak
up
now
and
explain
the
alternative
.

Mr.
Malpass
directs
the
Republican
staff
of
the
Joint
Economic
Committee
of
Congress
.

The
Chicago
Mercantile
Exchange
fined
and
suspended
two
commodities
traders
accused
of
making
prearranged
trades
with
each
other
that
allegedly
cheated
a
customer
.

Merc
officials
said
Gary
N.
Roberts
was
disciplined
following
the
exchange
's
investigation
of
his
trading
in
several
commodities
pits
from
July
to
November
1988
.

The
Merc
said
Mr.
Roberts
withheld
from
the
market
certain
orders
in
cooperation
with
another
trader
,
David
Stein
.

The
Merc
fined
Mr.
Roberts
$
15,000
and
suspended
his
trading
membership
for
three
years
.

Also
,
he
and
Mr.
Stein
were
ordered
to
make
restitution
of
$
35,000
to
a
customer
.

Mr.
Stein
was
fined
$
25,000
and
suspended
for
three
years
.

Messrs.
Roberts
and
Stein
could
n't
be
reached
for
comment
.

The
Merc
said
that
as
part
of
the
disciplinary
settlement
,
neither
man
admitted
,
nor
denied
the
alleged
violations
.

Neither
was
among
the
46
traders
indicted
last
August
in
a
federal
investigation
of
traders
at
both
the
Merc
and
the
Chicago
Board
of
Trade
.

In
a
move
that
could
pose
a
new
competitive
challenge
to
Time
Warner
Inc.
's
powerful
Home
Box
Office
,
cable
giant
Tele-Communications
Inc.
agreed
to
buy
half
of
Showtime
Networks
Inc.
from
Viacom
Inc.
for
$
225
million
.

The
purchase
comes
after
nearly
three
years
of
on-again
off-again
talks
between
TCI
and
Viacom
,
which
has
also
discussed
the
sale
of
an
interest
in
Showtime
with
other
cable
operators
.

Showtime
is
a
distant
No.
2
to
Home
Box
Office
,
and
in
May
filed
a
$
2.5
billion
antitrust
suit
against
Time
Warner
,
charging
the
company
and
its
HBO
and
American
Television
cable
units
with
conspiring
to
monopolize
the
pay
TV
business
.

HBO
has
close
to
24
million
subscribers
to
its
HBO
and
Cinemax
networks
,
while
Showtime
and
its
sister
service
,
The
Movie
Channel
,
have
only
about
10
million
,
according
to
Paul
Kagan
Associates
,
a
Carmel
,
Calif.
,
research
firm
.

For
TCI
,
the
investment
in
Showtime
puts
it
in
an
unusual
position
;
as
the
largest
cable
operator
,
with
control
of
close
to
12
million
of
the
nation
's
52
million
cable
subscribers
,
TCI
is
HBO
's
largest
customer
.

But
TCI
President
John
Malone
has
long
been
concerned
about
HBO
's
dominance
of
the
pay
TV
business
,
and
has
been
eager
to
keep
Showtime
as
a
healthy
competitor
.

``
It
is
important
to
the
cable
industry
that
we
have
a
vibrant
and
competitive
pay-television
marketplace
,
''
Mr.
Malone
said
in
a
statement
.

In
a
telephone
interview
,
Robert
Thomson
,
TCI
senior
vice
president
,
said
Showtime
's
suit
against
HBO
``
does
n't
involve
us
,
and
nothing
we
're
doing
here
bears
any
relationship
to
that
.
''

He
added
,
``
We
do
n't
intend
to
be
drawn
into
it
,
''
noting
that
TCI
wo
n't
play
any
active
role
in
the
management
of
Showtime
.

Linking
up
Showtime
with
the
largest
cable
operator
in
the
U.S.
could
sharply
boost
its
subscribers
.

TCI
said
it
may
bring
in
other
cable
operators
as
investors
,
a
practice
it
has
employed
in
the
past
with
investments
in
other
cable
networks
,
such
as
The
Discovery
Channel
.

Additional
cable
partners
could
boost
subscribers
even
further
.

Time
Warner
declined
comment
.

In
addition
to
owning
HBO
,
Time
Warner
owns
American
Television
&
Communications
Inc.
,
the
nation
's
second
largest
cable
operator
after
TCI
.

Viacom
also
owns
cable
systems
,
but
it
is
the
14th
largest
operator
of
such
systems
,
with
less
than
one
million
subscribers
.

The
TCI
investment
is
a
big
victory
for
Viacom
's
chief
executive
officer
,
Frank
Biondi
,
and
Winston
H.
Cox
,
president
of
the
Showtime
unit
.

``
This
takes
any
question
of
Showtime
's
viability
and
puts
it
away
once
and
for
all
,
''
Mr.
Biondi
said
in
a
telephone
interview
.

The
fight
between
HBO
and
Showtime
is
particularly
acrimonious
because
Mr.
Biondi
is
the
former
chief
executive
of
HBO
,
and
Mr.
Cox
served
as
chief
of
marketing
for
the
service
.

They
were
both
hired
by
Sumner
Redstone
,
the
Boston
billionaire
who
took
control
of
Viacom
three
years
ago
in
a
leveraged
buy-out
.

Time
Warner
has
vigorously
denied
all
of
Viacom
's
allegations
.

Boeing
Co.
,
already
struck
by
its
Machinists
union
,
briefly
called
off
contract
talks
with
its
engineers
and
labeled
their
demands
``
grossly
excessive
.
''

Later
,
however
,
the
company
agreed
to
meet
on
Monday
with
the
Seattle
Professional
Engineering
Employees
Association
after
a
federal
mediator
intervened
,
according
to
the
union
.

A
spokesman
for
the
engineers
said
the
company
asked
the
union
to
reduce
its
demands
,
which
included
a
19
%
pay
hike
in
the
first
year
and
8
%
in
the
second
and
third
years
.

The
union
represents
about
28,000
engineers
and
technical
workers
.

Its
contract
expires
Dec.
1
.

Meanwhile
,
a
federal
mediator
is
scheduled
to
meet
today
with
Boeing
officials
and
representatives
of
55,000
striking
Machinists
.

``
It
will
take
several
meetings
to
resolve
this
,
''
said
a
spokesman
for
the
Machinists
union
.

``
We
do
n't
want
to
bring
back
something
the
members
will
reject
.
''

Machinists
already
have
rejected
a
package
that
would
have
provided
a
10
%
pay
raise
plus
bonuses
over
the
three-year
life
of
the
contract
.

It
also
would
have
reduced
mandatory
overtime
.

Investor
Asher
Edelman
increased
his
stake
in
Intelogic
Trace
Inc.
and
cleared
the
way
for
additional
purchases
.

It
was
n't
clear
,
however
,
whether
the
actions
were
related
to
a
battle
between
the
corporate
raider
and
New
York
attorney
Martin
Ackerman
for
control
of
Datapoint
Corp.
,
a
San
Antonio
,
Texas-based
data-processing
systems
maker
.

Intelogic
Trace
,
a
computer
services
company
,
was
spun
off
to
Datapoint
holders
in
1985
,
after
Mr.
Edelman
gained
control
.

After
Mr.
Ackerman
announced
he
was
soliciting
consents
from
shareholders
in
order
to
wrest
control
of
Datapoint
from
Mr.
Edelman
,
the
corporate
raider
purchased
30
%
of
Datapoint
's
shares
.

In
a
Securities
and
Exchange
Commission
filing
,
Mr.
Edelman
said
from
Sept.
29
to
Oct.
13
,
he
acquired
309,500
shares
of
Intelogic
common
shares
for
$
2.25
to
$
2.375
each
.

The
purchases
increased
his
stake
to
16.2
%
of
the
shares
outstanding
.

The
filing
also
said
certain
provisions
which
apply
to
persons
acquiring
20
%
or
more
of
Intelogic
common
stock
,
were
waived
by
Intelogic
for
Mr.
Edelman
,
who
is
chairman
of
the
company
.

Mr.
Edelman
could
n't
be
reached
for
comment
.

The
federal
government
should
make
free
,
voluntary
testing
for
the
AIDS
virus
the
cornerstone
of
an
expanded
campaign
to
stop
the
spread
of
acquired
immune
deficiency
syndrome
,
the
Hudson
Institute
recommended
.

``
By
encouraging
massive
,
routine
,
voluntary
testing
we
can
enable
society
to
voluntarily
segregate
itself
sexually
into
two
groups
:
those
who
carry
the
virus
and
those
who
do
not
,
''
the
Indianapolis
research
organization
said
in
a
new
report
.

The
report
takes
a
more
alarmed
view
of
AIDS
and
recommends
a
more
sweeping
response
than
many
other
analyses
.

It
warns
that
the
AIDS
epidemic
``
may
reduce
the
rate
of
growth
of
the
work
force
,
curb
productivity
gains
and
slow
economic
growth
.
''

It
contends
that
current
government
policy
is
failing
to
stem
the
AIDS
epidemic
because
it
suggests
the
use
of
condoms
can
make
sex
``
safe
.
''

But
the
report
says
:
``
The
only
safe
sex
is
sex
between
uninfected
partners
,
''
and
testing
is
the
only
way
to
learn
of
infection
.

Hudson
's
researchers
estimated
that
it
would
cost
less
than
$
650
million
a
year
to
test
the
entire
population
between
the
ages
of
12
and
65
years
old
.

In
addition
,
the
report
recommends
that
federal
and
state
governments
provide
free
treatment
to
all
who
test
positive
.

An
unexpectedly
sharp
widening
in
the
U.S.
trade
gap
for
August
dragged
the
dollar
lower
Tuesday
,
but
profit-taking
on
short
positions
helped
the
currency
rebound
to
close
mixed
against
major
counterparts
.

While
the
market
kept
careful
tabs
on
Wall
Street
's
gyrations
,
it
shrugged
off
a
modest
downturn
in
equities
to
bid
the
dollar
well
above
the
day
's
lows
.

Soon
after
the
release
of
the
U.S.
trade
figures
,
the
dollar
plunged
to
an
intraday
low
of
140.95
yen
.

It
also
declined
against
the
mark
but
did
n't
reach
its
intraday
low
of
1.8435
marks
until
two
hours
later
.

The
unit
stabilized
about
midday
New
York
time
at
around
1.85
marks
and
141
yen
,
prompting
unconfirmed
rumors
that
the
U.S.
Federal
Reserve
had
intervened
to
blunt
the
unit
's
tumble
.

The
dollar
finished
at
its
intraday
highs
.

Dealers
noted
that
the
foreign
exchange
market
's
initial
bearish
reaction
to
the
U.S.
trade
figures
was
tempered
later
by
a
``
calmer
reassessment
of
the
data
.
''

The
U.S.
Commerce
Department
reported
a
$
10.77
billion
deficit
in
August
,
compared
with
a
revised
July
deficit
of
$
8.24
billion
.

Economists
had
expected
a
$
9.1
billion
gap
.

The
August
figure
reflected
a
6.4
%
rise
in
imports
and
a
0.2
%
drop
in
exports
.

Marc
M.
Goloven
,
an
economist
with
Manufacturers
Hanover
Trust
in
New
York
,
said
that
while
the
figures
appear
to
indicate
a
sadly
deteriorating
U.S.
trade
performance
,
there
's
still
enough
positive
news
in
the
data
to
justify
buying
dollars
.

He
said
that
while
the
U.S.
trade
gap
with
Canada
has
widened
significantly
,
the
trade
deficit
with
Western
Europe
and
Japan
continues
to
narrow
.

And
he
added
that
manufactured
goods
exports
are
still
rising
.

The
dollar
's
near-term
path
remains
foggy
,
according
to
currencny
analysts
,
who
characterize
the
market
as
``
bewildering
.
''

In
late
New
York
trading
yesterday
,
the
dollar
was
quoted
at
1.8667
marks
,
down
from
1.8685
marks
late
Monday
,
and
at
142.75
yen
,
up
from
141.85
yen
late
Monday
.

Sterling
was
unchanged
at
$
1.5753
.

In
Tokyo
Wednesday
,
the
U.S.
currency
opened
for
trading
at
142.55
yen
,
unchanged
from
Tuesday
's
Tokyo
close
.

Later
,
the
U.S.
currency
fell
to
about
142.25
yen
on
news
reports
of
the
San
Francisco
earthquake
.

Some
analysts
remain
bullish
and
point
out
that
the
dollar
continues
to
be
well
bid
despite
key
rate
increases
in
Europe
and
Japan
,
several
weeks
of
aggressive
dollar
sales
by
the
world
central
banks
--
some
traders
estimate
that
the
barrage
of
sales
topped
$
12
billion
--
and
a
190-point
plunge
on
the
New
York
Stock
Exchange
.

They
note
that
the
U.S.
unit
is
trading
at
the
upper
end
of
the
presumed
target
zones
established
by
the
Group
of
Seven
trading
partners
.

The
G-7

The
so-called
Louvre
accord
was
seen
to
have
set
ranges
of
1.70
marks
to
1.90
marks
and
120
yen
to
140
yen
.

They
say
that
the
recent
injection
of
liquidity
into
the
U.S.
banking
system
has
been
modest
,
and
they
do
n't
anticipate
significant
easing
by
the
U.S.
Federal
Reserve
.

The
Fed
arranged
$
1.5
billion
of
customer
repurchase
agreements
Tuesday
,
the
second
repurchase
agreement
in
two
days
.

The
move
,
which
injects
capital
into
the
system
,
is
seen
as
an
effort
to
reassure
the
finanicial
markets
that
the
U.S.
central
bank
is
ready
to
provide
the
ample
liquidity
.

But
other
analysts
contend
that
while
the
Fed
's
move
to
loosen
credit
has
n't
been
aggressive
,
it
nevertheless
sends
a
clear
signal
that
,
at
least
for
now
,
the
Fed
has
relaxed
its
grip
on
credit
.

They
add
that
the
Fed
has
allowed
the
key
federal
funds
interest
rate
to
dip
to
about
8
5\/8
%
from
its
levels
of
just
below
9
%
last
week
.

The
federal
funds
rate
is
the
overnight
lending
rate
that
banks
charge
each
other

National

Corp.
said
it
settled
a
four-year-old
patent
infringement
case
against
Linear
Technology
Corp.
by
accepting
a
$
3
million
payment
from
Linear
in
exchange
for
granting
Linear
irrevocable
licenses
for
all
products
involved
.

The
two
companies
also
agreed
to
settle
any
future
property
rights
issues
over
the
next
10
years
through
binding
arbitration
,
both
companies
said
.

The
products
are
so-called
analog
integrated
circuits
that
have
applications
in
the
consumer
electronics
,
automobile
and
electronic
instrumentation
markets
.

Linear
Technology
,
Milpitas
,
Calif.
,
called
the
settlement
``
positive
,
''
since
products
covered
by
the
disputed
patents
account
for
about
20
%
of
its
annual
sales
.

The
electronics
concern
said
it
already
has
paid
$
2
million
of
the
settlement
to
National
Semiconductor
,
Santa
Clara
,
Calif.
,
and
will
pay
the
remaining
$
1
million
in
equal
installments

The
payments
are

expected
to
have

The

reign
as
the

snapped
yesterday
by

Procter

expanding
its

said
it
acquired
Maryland

Foods
,
a
coffee
supplier
,
from
an
investor
group
led
by
F.
Philip
Handy
of
Winter

Houston-based
Maryland
Club
Foods
,
which
had
sales
of
about
$
200
million
last
year
,
sells
coffee
under
the
Maryland
Club
and
Butter-Nut
brands
to
restaurants
,
hotels
,
offices
and
airlines
.

The
acquisition
``
gives
us
additional
production
capacity
for
the
food
service
coffee
business
and
a
stronger
distribution
network
,
''
a
P&G
spokesman
said
.

P&G
already
sells
its
Folgers
ground
roast
coffee
to
food
service
concerns
,
but
not
to
as
many
markets
as
Maryland
Club
.

For
example
,
P&G
up
until
now
has
n't
sold
coffee
to
airlines
and
does
only
limited
business
with
hotels
and
large
restaurant
chains
.

Maryland
Club
also
distributes
tea
,
which
fits
well
with
P&G
's
Tender
Leaf
brand
,
and
hot
cocoa
products
.

The
company
said
the
acquisition
has
been
completed
and
reviewed
by
the
Federal
Trade
Commission

The
purchase
includes
a
coffee-roasting
plant
in

of
Dutch
institutional
investors
.

MacMillan

said
the
8.1

loan
is
due
Oct.

,
1996

will
be
used
to

President
Bush
will
veto
a
bill
funding
the
Departments
of
Labor
,
Education
and
Health
and
Human
Services
because
it
would
allow
federal
funding
of
abortions
for
victims
of
rape
and
incest
,
the
White
House
said
.

Mr.
Bush
had
threatened
a
veto
previously
.

But
he
put
off
a
firm
decision
while
his
aides
and
legislators
searched
for
a
compromise
that
would
tighten
requirements
for
such
abortions
in
a
way
acceptable
to
the
president
.

White
House
Press
Secretary
Marlin
Fitzwater
said
negotiations
between
Bush
aides
and
lawmakers
ended
Monday
without
success
.

Most
lawmakers
think
it
will
be
extremely
difficult
for
Mr.
Bush
's
opponents
on
the
abortion
issue
to
round
up
the
votes
needed
to
override
the
veto
.

But
there
still
may
be
prolonged
debate
and
political
maneuvering
that
holds
up
the
$
156.7
billion
funding
bill
for
the
fiscal
year
that
began
Oct.
1
.

Mr.
Bush
has
said
he
personally
approves
of
abortions
in
the
cases
of
rape
,
incest
and
danger
to
the
life
of
the
mother
.

But
he
has
opposed
Medicaid
funding
of
abortions
for
poor
women
who
say
they
are
victims
of
rape
and
incest
,
arguing
that
those
exceptions
are
enforced
so
loosely
that
they
open
the
way
for
abortions
for
other
women
.

J.P.

,
will
help
the
statutory
managers
of
DFC
New
Zealand
Ltd.
to
evaluate
the
failed
investment
bank
's
condition
.

Earlier
this
month
,
the
Reserve
Bank
of
New
Zealand
,
the
country
's
central
bank
,
appointed
the
managers
to
run
the
investment
bank
and
pay
creditors
.

DFC
asked
the
central
bank
to
appoint
managers
after
it
revised
loan-loss
provisions
to
around
the
same
level
of
shareholders
'
funds
of
180
million
New
Zealand
dollars
(
US$
105.4
million
)
.

DFC
is
held
80
%
by
National
Provident
Fund
,
New

's
largest
pension
fund
,
and
20
%
by
Salomon
Brothers
Inc.
,
the
investment-bank
and
securities-firm
subsidiary
of
Salomon
Inc.
in
New

.

A
spokeswoman
for
J.P.
Morgan
,
parent
of
the
bank
Morgan
Guaranty
Trust
Co.
,
confirmed
its
appointment
to
assist
the
managers
but
declined
to
elaborate
.

The
managers
said
in
a
brief
statement
yesterday
that
Morgan
will
help
evaluate
DFC
's
position
and
help
determine
alternatives
.

The
managers
do
n't
expect
to
complete
the
evaluation
until
Nov.
30

An
experimental
vaccine
can
alter
the
immune
response
of
people
infected
with
the
AIDS
virus
,
a
prominent
U.S.
scientist
said
.

However
,
that
does
n't
mean
they
can
benefit
from
the
vaccine
.

Its
effectiveness
ca
n't
be
determined
until
a
large
clinical
trial
is
undertaken
by
the
Army
in
January
,
according
to
Robert
Redfield
,
chief
of
acquired
immune
deficiency
syndrome
research
at
Walter
Reed
Army
Institute
of
Research
.

Dr.
Redfield
's
report
on
early
experiments
using
an
AIDS
vaccine
made
by
MicroGeneSys
Inc.
of
West
Haven
,
Conn.
,
came
at
a
meeting
of
AIDS
vaccine
researchers
in
Florida
late
Monday
.

The
vaccine
,
VaxSyn
HIV-1
,
has
been
safely
given
to
14
people
,
some
of
whom
are
experiencing
substantial
increases
in
certain
antibodies
.

``
The
conventional
wisdom
used
to
be
that
you
could
n't
modify
the
immune
response
of
an
infected
individual
''
by
innoculating
them
with
synthetic
viral
proteins
,
Dr.
Redfield
said
.

``
We
've
demonstrated
that
you
can
.
''

He
said
certain
volunteers
developed
kinds
of
antibodies
associated
with
early
AIDS
.

Other
antibodies
sparked
by
the
preparation
are
of
a
sort
rarely
present
in
large
quantities
in
infected
or
ill
individuals
,
he
added
.

One
of
the
mysteries
of
AIDS
remains
why
infected
people
produce
large
quantities
of
antibodies
,
but
deteriorate
nonetheless
.

Cross

Matra
S.A.
reported
its
1989
first-half
profit
soared
88
%
,
and
indicated
that
its
previous
estimate
of
a
50
%
rise
in
earnings
for
all
of
1989
will
be
exceeded
by
a
wide
margin
.

The
French
electronics
and
defense
group
said
attributable
consolidated
net
profit
for
the
first
six
months
of
1989
totaled
244
million
francs
(
$
38.4
million
)
,
compared
with
130
million
francs
(
$
20.5
million
)
in
the
corresponding
period
of

Operating
profit
climbed
51
%
,
to
572
million
francs
from
378
million
in
the
first
half
of
1988
.

Matra
said
the
sharp
improvement
in
net
profit
partly
reflected
a
decline
of
59
million
francs
in
the
group
's
net
loss
from
nonrecurring
items
in
the
first
half
of
this
year
to
104
million
francs
from
163
million
a
year
earlier
.

There
was
also
a
decline
in
the
group
's
net
financial
costs
to
25
million
francs
from
50
million
a
year
before
.

These
movements
were
offset
,
however
,
by
a
steep
rise
in
corporate
income
tax
payments
to
199
million
francs
from
35
million
in
the
first
six
months
of
1988
.

Matra
said
the
sharp
rise
in
its
first-half
earnings
was
based
on
a
15
%
gain
in
consolidated
revenue
to
10.16
billion
francs
from
8.85
billion
a
year
earlier
.

Rep.
Lee
Hamilton
(
D.
,
Ind
.
)
said
he
and
Rep.
Byron
Dorgan
(
D.
,
N.D
.
)
are
backing
away
from
their
proposal
to
make
the
Treasury
Secretary
a
voting
member
of
the
Federal
Reserve
panel
that
sets
monetary
policy
.

Rep.
Hamilton
said
the
bill
will
be
modified
substantially
to
call
for
two
meetings
each
year
between
the
Fed
's
open
market
committee
and
the
Treasury
Secretary
,
the
chairman
of
the
Council
of
Economic
Advisers
and
the
director
of
the
Office
of
Management
and
Budget
.

The
original
bill
was
strongly
opposed
by
the
Fed
and
publicly
criticized
by
friends
of
the
Fed
as
an
attempt
to
undermine
the
central
bank
's
independence
.

Fed
critics
,
however
,
hailed
it
as
a
long
overdue
attempt
to
bring
a
measure
of
openness
and
democracy
to
the
setting
of
monetary
policy
.

Rep.
Hamilton
said
the
purpose
of
the
meetings
would
be
to
``
improve
communications
and
perhaps
coordination
between
the
executive
branch
and
the
Fed
.

B.F.
Goodrich
Co.
said
third-quarter
profits
dropped
34
%
because
of
lower
prices
for
polyvinyl
chloride
materials
,
the
company
's
largest
product
group
.

Net

to
$
40.1

slipped
2.7
%
to

Polyvinyl

capacity
``

a
result

Prices
for
general-purpose
PVC
resin
have
dropped
more

is
used
in

Fiat
S.p
.
A.
,
Italy
's
leading
industrial
group
,
is
conducting
``
concrete
''
talks
with
West
Germany
's
Daimler-Benz
AG
on
a
series
of
projects
in
the
aerospace
sector
,
Fiat
officials
said
.

However
,
the
officials
said
it
was
too
early
to
disclose
the
nature
of
the
proposed
projects
or
indicate
when
the
talks
might
be
concluded
.

Daimler-Benz
Chairman
Edzard
Reuter
told
Milan
's
financial
daily
Il
Sole
24
Ore
that
talks
are
taking
place
between
both
companies
'
aerospace
units
.

``
While
Mr.
Reuter
's
comments
please
us
very
much
,
there
currently
are
no
talks
in
progress
regarding
the
automotive
industry
,
''
a
Fiat
spokeswoman
said
.

In
the
interview
,
Mr.
Reuter
said
he
is
thinking
foremost
of
cooperation
in
the
truck
sector
,
but
``
in
the
long
run
,
I
do
n't
want
to
rule
out
that
we
can
also
come
a
bit
closer
in
personal
cars
.
''

Roberto
Morelli
,
Italy
analyst
for
County
Natwest
Securities
in
London
,
said
that
right
now
``
the
market
is
n't
being
influenced
by
that
kind
of
news
,
''
referring
to
the
conditional
nature
of
the
talks
mentioned
by
Mr.
Reuter
and
by
the
uncertainty
surrounding
world
stock
exchanges
this
week
.

Paul
Tanner
was
named
president
,
chief
executive
officer
and
chairman
of
this
oil
and
natural
gas
company
.

He
succeeds
John
A.
Boudreau
,
who
resigned
for
personal
reasons
.

Mr.
Tanner
had
been
president
of
Penn
Pacific
's
National
Southwest
Capital
Group
subsidiary
.

Mr.
Boudreau
will
remain
with
Penn
Pacific
as
a
director
and
a
member
of
the
executive
committee
.

He
has
also
agreed
to
become
president
of
a
new
subsidiary
to
be
formed
to
make
future
acquisitions
,
the
company
said
.

Spooked
investors
,
despite
their
stampede
to
dump
takeover
stocks
,
should
hold
on
tight
to
their
Jaguar
shares
.

That
's
the
view
of
some
analysts
here
who
argue
that
Britain
's
leading
maker
of
luxury
cars
still
may
have
two
U.S.
auto
giants
battling
for
it
.

Yesterday
,
Ford
Motor
disclosed
that
it
has
raised
its
holding
in
Jaguar
to
10.4
%
from
5
%
.

Both
Ford
and
its
rival
General
Motors
recently
set
their
sights
on
grabbing
significant
minority
stakes
in
the
British
company
.

Ford
's
latest
move
increases
the
pressure
on
GM
to
complete
its
current
talks
with
Jaguar
quickly
.

GM
is
likely
to
reach
the
cooperative
operating
pact
it
has
been
seeking
in
about
two
weeks
,
knowledgeable
individuals
say
.

At
that
point
investors
may
face
a
long
,
bumpy
ride
.

A
victor
in
the
fight
for
Jaguar
may
not
emerge
until
after
the
expiration
late
next
year
of
British
government
takeover
restrictions
.

The
curbs
prevent
a
buyer
from
purchasing
more
than
15
%
of
Jaguar
shares
without
permission
.

``
This
is
an
exceptionally
odd
takeover
battle
,
''
says
London
analyst
Christopher
Will
of
Shearson
Lehman
Hutton
.

Jaguar
's
American
depositary
receipts
were
up
3\/8
yesterday
in
a
down
market
,
closing
at
10
3\/8
.

(
Jaguar
's
ADRs
make
the
company
one
of
the
most
widely
held
United
Kingdom
stocks
in
the
U.S.
,
with
more
than
one-fourth
of
its
shares
owned
there
.
)

Jaguar
topped
the
most-active
list
for
the
U.S.
over-the-counter
market
Monday
.

And
on
London
's
Stock
Exchange
Monday
,
18.5
million
shares
were
traded
,
far
above
the
usual
volume
.

Ford
's
share
purchases
undoubtedly
accounted
for
much
of
Monday
's
heavy
trading
.

Last
week
,
many
Jaguar
shareholders
took
their
money
and
ran
.

Fears
that
Ford
's
ardor
might
be
cooling
put
Jaguar
shares
into
reverse
after
GM
confirmed
its
friendly
negotiations
with
Jaguar
.

But
yesterday
's
announcement
indicates
that
Ford
has
n't
lost
interest
.

Both
Shearson
's
Mr
.
Will
and
Stephen
Reitman
,
European
auto
analyst
at
the
London
brokerage
firm
UBS-Phillips
&
Drew
,
recently
switched
their
Jaguar
recommendations
to
hold
from
buy
.

``
Sit
tight
''
through
the
coming
volatility
,
Mr.
Reitman
suggests
,
though
he
concedes
that
many
small
investors
will
find
Jaguar
's
zigzags
``
too
hard
to
swallow
.
''

But
a
crucial
point
is
how
Ford
reacts
when
GM
,
the
world
's
largest
auto
maker
,
firms
up
its
proposed
deal
with
Jaguar
.

At
the
moment
,
Ford
executives
will
say
little
beyond
reiterating
their
desire
to
raise
Ford
's
Jaguar
stake
to
about
15
%
.

GM
is
expected
to
inject
roughly
#
200
million
(
$
316
million
)
by
acquiring
some
Jaguar
shares
,
and
then
win
Jaguar
management
's
promise
of
an
eventual
30
%
stake
.

Analysts
believe
the
car
makers
also
will
create
joint
ventures
to
develop
new
executive
models
,
doubling
Jaguar
's
yearly
output
of
50,000
cars
.

Jaguar
shareholders
would
have
to
bless
such
a
far-reaching
accord
.

Ford
might
challenge
the
proposal
by
offering
a
full
bid
if
holders
and
the
U.K.
government
agreed
to
drop
the
anti-takeover
barrier
early
.

``
I
think
Ford
is
going
to
come
out
with
full
guns
blazing
,
''
Mr.
Reitman
says
.

``
Ford
wants
{
Jaguar
}
very
much
.
''

U.S.
takeover-stock
speculators
,
who
may
own
between
20
%
and
30
%
of
Jaguar
,
could
give
Ford
enough
votes
to
block
the
GM
deal
.

GM
might
counterbid
.

Then
,
Mr
.
Will
says
,
``
you
get
a
bidding
war
between
two
very
rich
,
very
determined
international
companies
.
''

He
believes
Jaguar
's
share
price
could
zoom
to
between
#
8
and
#
10
(
$
12.60
to
$
15.80
)
.

``
There
's
quite
a
bit
of
value
left
in
the
{
Jaguar
}
shares
here
even
though
they
have
run
up
''
lately
,
says
Doug
Johnson
,
a
fund
manager
for
Seattle-based
Safeco
Asset
Management
.

At
the
moment
,
he
intends
to
keep
the
firm
's
180,000
Jaguar
shares
.

The
risk
is
that
Jaguar
's
share
price
could
slump
if
GM
's
agreement
with
Jaguar
effectively
locks
out
its
U.S.
rival
.

``
Ford
's
appetite
to
attack
{
Jaguar
}
could
gradually
wane
over
time
,
particularly
if
Saab
is
a
reasonably
attractive
proposition
,
''
says
John
Lawson
,
an
auto
analyst
at
London
's
Nomura
Research
Institute
.

He
thinks
Saab-Scania
AB
on
Friday
will
announce
the
sale
of
50
%
of
its
car
division
to
Ford
;
the
companies
have
been
discussing
closer
cooperation
for
months
.

Clifford
Stahl
,
president
and
chief
investment
officer
of
C-S
Capital
Advisors
Inc.
,
two
weeks
ago
sold
his
Cincinnati
firm
's
107,100
Jaguar
ADRs
at
about
10
each
,
making
a
tidy
profit
on
a
holding
purchased
at
4
7\/8
in
early
May
.

``
I
thought
the
probabilities
of
{
a
bidding
war
}
happening
were
less
,
''
he
says
.

Of
course
,
that
was
before
Ford
's
latest
move
.

Mr.

a

Newport
Electronics
Inc.
of
Santa
Ana
,
Calif.
,
said
Milton
B.
Hollander
,
who
holds
a
49.4
%
stake
,
requested
a
special
shareholders
'
meeting
next
Wednesday
to
remove
four
current
directors
and
elect
an
alternative
slate
.

Mr.
Hollander
's
High
Technology
Holding
Co.
of
Stamford
,
Conn.
,
acquired
most
of
its
stake
last
August
in
an
$
11-a-share
tender
offer
for
Newport
,
a
maker
of
electronic-measuring
devices
.

Newport
said
Mr.
Hollander
is
asking
shareholders
to
retain
only
one
director
,
James
R.
Lees
,
a
Newport
vice
president
.

The
board
is
n't
proposing
a

of
its
own
and
the
other
four
current

do
n't
want
to
serve
beyond
the
special
meeting
date
,
Newport
said
.

Mr.
Hollander
``

said
Barret
B.

,
Newport

Sandoz
AG
,
a
major
Swiss
chemical
and
pharmaceutical
group
,
said
that
its
group
sales
rose
25
%
to
9.482
billion
francs
(
$
5.80
billion
)
in
the
first
nine
months
of
this
year
,
with
strong
gains
in
all
divisions
.

A
year
earlier
sales
totaled
7.567
billion
francs
.

Positive
currency
rates
and
strong
sales
growth
led
to
a
substantial
rise
in
consolidated
profit
in
the
period
,
although
the
company
did
n't
provide
figures
,
as
is
customary
with
Swiss
companies
.

Sandoz
said
it
expects
a
``
substantial
increase
''
in
consolidated
profit
for
the
full
year
,
barring
major
currency
rate
changes
.

Amstrad
PLC
,
a
British
maker
of
computer
hardware
and
communications
equipment
,
posted
a
52
%
plunge
in
pretax
profit
for
the
latest
year
.

The
#
76.6
million
(
$
120.6
million
)
in
pretax
profit
for
the
12
months
to
June
30
was
down
from
#
160
million
(
$
252
million
)
a
year
earlier
and
below
market
expectations
of
#
80
million
and
#
90
million
.

The
slump
in
profit
,
which
came
despite
steady
sales
,
was
attributed
to
increased
costs
for
parts
and
problems
with
model
introductions
.

Amstrad
's
profit
after
taxes
fell
a
similarly
steep
51
%
,
to

Microsoft
Corp.
's
earnings
growth
continued
to
outstrip
that
of
most
of
its
competitors
and
customers
in
the
personal-computer
industry
,
as
it
reported
a
36
%
jump
in
fiscal
first-quarter
earnings
on
a
33
%
revenue
gain
.

The
Redmond
,
Wash.
company
,
a
bellwether
provider
of
operating
systems
and
software
for
personal-computer
makers
and
users
,
reported
net
income
for
the
quarter
ended
Sept.
30
of
$
49.6
million
,
or
87
cents
a
share
,
up
from
$
36.6
million
,
or
65
cents
a
share
,
in
the
year-ago
period
.

Revenue
rose
to
$
235.2
million
,
from
$
176.4
million
.

Microsoft
previously
indicated
it
would
have
a
strong
quarter
by
forecasting
its
revenue
gain
on
Oct.
4
,
causing
a
$
6.50
a
share
jump
in
its
stock
.

But
its
stock
jumped
again
yesterday
as
it
disclosed
surprisingly
strong
margins
on
those
sales
.

Microsoft
's
stock
rose
$
2.875
a
share
in
national
over-the-counter
trading
to
$
78.625
.

The
stock
had
hit
a
high
of
$
81
a
share
early
last
week
but
collapsed
to
$
73.50
in
the
Friday
stock
plunge
.

The
company
had
been
experiencing
softening
margins
because
of
increased
sales
of
software
applications
,
which
have
lower
margins
than
do
operating
systems
.

But
the
company
said
that
trend
was
offset
in
the
first
quarter
by
better
economies
of
scale
and
efficiencies
in
manufacturing
.

As
a
result
,
Microsoft
's
cost
of
goods
,
as
a
percentage
of
sales
,
fell
17
%
from
the
year-ago
quarter
and
13
%
from
the
previous
period
.

The
trend
drove
up
the
aftertax
margin
--
net
income
as
a
percentage
of
revenues
--
to
21.1
%
in
the
quarter
,
compared
with
20.7
%
a
year
earlier
.

Microsoft
officials
said
the
strong
results
also
reflected
continuing
high
demand
for
its
software
applications
and
operating
systems
.

While
it
has
predicted
that
overall
growth
in
unit
sales
of
personal
computers
is
slowing
to
about
a
10
%
yearly
rate
,
its
own
products
are
selling
at
a
much
faster
rate
because
many
are
geared
to
the
high-performance
end
of
the
market
.

That
segment
continues
to
post
strong
quarter-to-quarter
gains
,
while
the
low-end
,
or
commodity
segment
,
of
the
industry
is
experiencing
sluggish
growth
or
even
sales
declines
.

Compared
with
its
previous
quarter
,
the
final
period
of
its
1989
fiscal
year
,
net
rose
9
%
,
and
sales
rose
7
%
.

Control
Data
Corp.
,
Minneapolis
,
signed
a
joint
development
agreement
with
MIPS
Computer
Systems
Inc.

incorporate
an
emerging

MIPS
is

in
what
is
known
as
reduced-instruction
set
computing
,
or
RISC
,
a
technology
combining

sophisticated
software
.

In
joining
MIPS
,
Control
Data
follows
several
competitors
in
embracing
RISC
as
a
new
design
approach
.

Digital
Equipment
Corp.
,
Tandem

and
Group
Bull
,
among
others
,
have
similar
arrangements
with
MIPs
,
based

Sunnyvale
,
Calif
.

Control
Data
said
it
expects
its
first
RISC-based
mainframe
machine
to
be
introduced
next
year
.

The
accord
with
MIPS
calls
for
Control
Data
to
share
its
expertise
in
data
storage
,
the
companies
said
.

Control

Paul

general

,
a
venture-capital
firm
based
in
Menlo

was
named
a

of
this
computer
company
.

Mr.
Ely
,
57
years

temporarily
increases
the
board
to
seven

BroadBeach
Associates
Inc.
,
the
Los
Angeles
investment
partnership
whose
$
62-a-share
bid
for
McGill
Manufacturing
Co.
was
topped
recently
by
a
competing
offer
from
a
Swedish
concern
,
disclosed
that
it
sold
its
entire
7
%
McGill
stake
.

McGill
,
a
Valparaiso
,
Ind.
,
ball-bearing
manufacturer
,
had
rebuffed
BroadBeach
's
proposal
.

It
has
since
asked
holders
not
to
immediately
tender
their
shares
under
a
recent
$
72-a-share
,
or
$
104
million
,
bid
from
AB
SKF
of
Sweden
,
until
McGill
directors
have
completed
their
evaluation
.

In
a
Securities
and
Exchange
Commission
filing
,
BroadBeach
said
it
sold
the
101,000
McGill
shares
for
$
7.3
million
in
a
private
transaction
on
Oct.
12
.

BroadBeach
did
n't
identify
the
buyer
of
the
shares
,
but
the
date
of
the
selloff
followed
by
one
day
the
Swedish
concern
's

offer
,
and
the
indicated
price
of
the
shares
sold
equals
SKF
's

price
.

A
BroadBeach
spokeswoman
said
the

sold

stock
in

open
market
and
thus
could
n't
identify
the
buyer
or

Luis
Nogales
,
45
years
old
,
has
been
elected
to
the
board
of
this
brewer
.

Mr.
Nogales
,
former
president
of
United
Press
International
and
the
Univision
Spanish-language
network
,
most
recently
co-founded
Nogales
Castro
Partners
,
a
California-based
media
acquisition
firm
.

Mr.
Nogales
,
the
first
Hispanic
person
to
serve
as
a
Coors
director
,
is
an
addition
to
the
board
,
increasing
its
membership
to
nine

Hachette
S.A.
,
a
European
media
and
publishing
group
,
reported
a
small
rise
in
its
attributable
first-half
group
profit
,
excluding
exceptional
items
,
to
133.8
million
francs
(
$
21.1
million
)
from
130.1
million
francs
a
year
earlier
.

The
Paris-based
group
said
its
earlier
projection
--
that
group
profit
for
all
of
1989
would
be
close
to
the
322.7
million
francs
posted
for
1988
--
remains
valid
.

Taking
into
account
nonrecurring
gains
and
losses
,
Hachette
's
group
net
income
for
the
first
six
months
of
this
year
totaled
246.6
million
francs
,
practically
double
the
year-earlier
figure
of
124.5
million
francs
.

Analysts
said
Hachette
's
earnings
in
the
second
half
might
be
boosted
by
a
capital
gain
from
the
sale
of
the
Paris
headquarters
of
a
newspaper-delivery
company
that
is
49
%
owned
by
Hachette
.

Oncor
Inc.
,
Gaithersburg
,
Md.
,
said
it
received
approval
from
the
U.S.
Food
and
Drug
Administration
to
market
a
genetic
test
that
will
assist
in
diagnosis
and
treatment
of
leukemia
and
lymph
cancer
.

The
B\/T
gene
rearrangement
test
is
more
accurate
than
existing
tests
for
diagnosing
the
type
of
cancer
,
whether
it
has
spread
or
whether
there
is
a
recurrence
following
treatment
,
said
Oncor
President
Stephen
Turner
.

Mr.
Turner
said
the
test
initially
will
be
used
in
conjunction
with
biopsies
and
other
tests
,
but
eventually
might
become
the
benchmark
for
tumor
analysis
.

Mr.
Turner
said
the
test
will
be
shipped
in
45
days
to
hospitals
and
clinical
laboratories
.

Dr.
Wyndham
Wilson
,
a
cancer
treatment
specialist
at
the
National
Cancer
Institute
,
said
the
test
is
widely
used
in
research
centers
but
is
n't
having
a
major
impact
because
it
is
only
occasionally
useful
in
choosing
the
most
effective
treatment
.

But
the
test
may
prove
to
be
more
sensitive
in
determining
whether
a
tumor
has
spread
or
returned
following
treatment
,
Dr.
Wilson
said
.

``
We
do
n't
know
yet
how
useful
it
's
going
to
be
,
''
he
said
.

Oncor
,
a
six-year-old
developer
of
genetic
medical
tests
,
projects
that
the
cancer
test
will
help
it
to
post
its
first-ever
profit
during
the
first
quarter
of
1990
,
Mr.
Turner
said
.

The
company
will
charge
$
35
for
a
test
and
projects
about
$
2
million
in
revenue
from
the
test
during
the
first
12
months
of
marketing
,
he
said
.

Unilab
Corp.
,
Norcross
,
Ga.
,
said
it
acquired
the
clinical
laboratories
of
closely
held
Central
Diagnostic
Laboratory
Inc.
in
a
cash
and
securities
transaction
valued
at
$
85
million
.

Unilab
said
its
wholly
owned
MetWest
Inc.
unit
paid
$
25
million
in
cash
,
provided
$
30
million
in
notes
and
$
30
million
in
preferred
stock
to
acquire
Central
's
labs
in
the
Western
U.S.
.

Unilab
,
which
provides
clinical
laboratory
services
,
competed
with
Central
,
based
in
Tarzana
,
Calif.
,
in
a
number
of
areas
.

Beyond
removing
a
competitor
,
the
combination
should
provide
``
synergies
,
''
said
Fred
Harlow
,
Unilab
's
chief
financial
officer
.

It
also
will
hand
Unilab
new
markets
.

In
Los
Angeles
,
for
example
,
Central
has
had
a
strong
market
position
while
Unilab
's
presence
has
been
less
prominent
,
according
to
Mr.
Harlow
.

Consumers
may
want
to
move
their
telephones
a
little
closer
to
the
TV
set
.

Couch-potato
jocks
watching
ABC
's
``
Monday
Night
Football
''
can
now
vote
during
halftime
for
the
greatest
play
in
20
years
from
among
four
or
five
filmed
replays
.

Two
weeks
ago
,
viewers
of
several
NBC
daytime
consumer
segments
started
calling
a
900
number
for
advice
on
various
life-style
issues
.

And
the
new
syndicated
``
reality
''
show
``
Hard
Copy
''
records
viewers
'
opinions
for
possible
airing
on
the
next
day
's
show
.

Interactive
telephone
technology
has
taken
a
new
leap
in
sophistication
,
and
television
programmers
are
racing
to
exploit
the
possibilities
.

Eventually
viewers
may
grow
bored
with
the
technology
and
resent
the
cost
.

But
right
now
programmers
are
figuring
that
viewers
who
are
busy
dialing
up
a
range
of
services
may
put
down
their
remote
control
zappers
and
stay
tuned
.

``
We
've
been
spending
a
lot
of
time
in
Los
Angeles
talking
to
TV
production
people
,
''
says
Mike
Parks
,
president
of
Call
Interactive
,
which
supplied
technology
for
both
ABC
Sports
and
NBC
's
consumer
minutes
.

``
With
the
competitiveness
of
the
television
market
these
days
,
everyone
is
looking
for
a
way
to
get
viewers
more
excited
.
''

One
of
the
leaders
behind
the
expanded
use
of
900
numbers
is
Call
Interactive
,
a
joint
venture
of
giants
American
Express
Co.
and
American
Telephone
&
Telegraph
Co
.

Formed
in
August
,
the
venture
weds
AT&T
's
newly
expanded
900
service
with
200
voice-activated
computers
in
American
Express
's
Omaha
,
Neb.
,
service
center
.

Other
long-distance
carriers
have
also
begun
marketing
enhanced
900
service
,
and
special
consultants
are
springing
up
to
exploit
the
new
tool
.

Blair
Entertainment
,
a
New
York
firm
that
advises
TV
stations
and
sells
ads
for
them
,
has
just
formed
a
subsidiary
--
900
Blair
--
to
apply
the
technology
to
television
.

The
use
of
900
toll
numbers
has
been
expanding
rapidly
in
recent
years
.

For
a
while
,
high-cost
pornography
lines
and
services
that
tempt
children
to
dial
(
and
redial
)
movie
or
music
information
earned
the
service
a
somewhat
sleazy
image
,
but
new
legal
restrictions
are
aimed
at
trimming
excesses
.

The
cost
of
a
900
call
is
set
by
the
originator
--
ABC
Sports
,
for
example
--
with
the
cheapest
starting
at
75
cents
.

Billing
is
included
in
a
caller
's
regular
phone
bill
.

From
the
fee
,
the
local
phone
company
and
the
long-distance
carrier
extract
their
costs
to
carry
the
call
,
passing
the
rest
of
the
money
to
the
originator
,
which
must
cover
advertising
and
other
costs
.

In
recent
months
,
the
technology
has
become
more
flexible
and
able
to
handle
much
more
volume
.

Before
,
callers
of
900
numbers
would
just
listen
and
not
talk
,
or
they
'd
vote
``
yes
''
or
``
no
''
by
calling
one
of
two
numbers
.

(
People
in
the
phone
business
call
this
technology
``
900
click
.
''
)

Now
,
callers
are
led
through
complex
menus
of
choices
to
retrieve
information
they
want
,
and
the
hardware
can
process
10,000
calls
in
90
seconds
.

Up
to
now
,
900
numbers
have
mainly
been
used
on
local
TV
stations
and
cable
channels
.

MTV
used
one
to
give
away
the
house
that
rock
star
Jon
Bon
Jovi
grew
up
in
.

For
several
years
,
Turner
Broadcasting
System
's
Cable
News
Network
has
invited
viewers
to
respond
nightly
to
topical
issues
(
``
Should
the
U.S.
military
intervene
in
Panama
?
''
)
,
but
even
the
hottest
controversies
on
CNN
log
only
about
10,000
calls
.

The
newest
uses
of
the
900-interactive
technology
demonstrate
the
growing
variety
of
applications
.

Capital
Cities\/ABC
Inc.
,
CBS
Inc.
and
General
Electric
Co.
's
National
Broadcasting
Co.
unit
are
expected
to
announce
soon
a
joint
campaign
to
raise
awareness
about
hunger
.

The
subject
will
be
written
into
the
plots
of
prime-time
shows
,
and
viewers
will
be
given
a
900
number
to
call
.

Callers
will
be
sent
educational
booklets
,
and
the
call
's
modest
cost
will
be
an
immediate
method
of
raising
money
.

Other
network
applications
have
very
different
goals
.

ABC
Sports
was
looking
for
ways
to
lift
deflated
halftime
ratings
for
``
Monday
Night
Football
.
''

Kurt
Sanger
,
ABC
Sports
's
marketing
director
,
says
that
now
``
tens
of
thousands
''
of
fans
call
its
900
number
each
week
to
vote
for
the
best
punt
return
,
quarterback
sack
,
etc
.

Profit
from
the
calls
goes
to
charity
,
but
ABC
Sports
also
uses
the
calls
as
a
sales
tool
:
After
thanking
callers
for
voting
,
Frank
Gifford
offers
a
football
videotape
for
$
19.95
,
and
5
%
of
callers
stay
on
the
line
to
order
it
.

Jackets
may
be
sold
next
.

Meanwhile
,
NBC
Sports
recently
began
``
Scores
Plus
,
''
a
year-round
,
24-hour
900
line
providing
a
complex
array
of
scores
,
analysis
and
fan
news
.

A
spokesman
said
its
purpose
is
``
to
bolster
the
impression
that
NBC
Sports
is
always
there
for
people
.
''

NBC
's
``
On-Line
''
consumer
minutes
have
increased
advertiser
spending
during
the
day
,
the
network
's
weakest
period
.

Each
weekday
matches
a
sponsor
and
a
topic
:
On
Mondays
,
Unilever
N.V.
's
Lever
Bros.
sponsors
tips
on
diet
and
exercise
,
followed
by
a
30-second
Lever
Bros.
commercial
.

Viewers
can
call
a
900
number
for
additional
advice
,
which
will
be
tailored
to
their
needs
based
on
the
numbers
they
punch
(
``
Press
one
if
you
're
pregnant
,
''
etc
.
)
.

If
the
caller
stays
on
the
line
and
leaves
a
name
and
address
for
the
sponsor
,
coupons
and
a
newsletter
will
be
mailed
,
and
the
sponsor
will
be
able
to
gather
a
list
of
desirable
potential
customers
.

Diane
Seaman
,
an
NBC-TV
vice
president
,
says
NBC
has
been
able
to
charge
premium
rates
for
this
ad
time
.

She
would
n't
say
what
the
premium
is
,
but
it
's
believed
to
be
about
40
%
above
regular
daytime
rates
.

``
We
were
able
to
get
advertisers
to
use
their
promotion
budget
for
this
,
because
they
get
a
chance
to
do
couponing
,
''
says
Ms.
Seaman
.

``
And
we
were
able
to
attract
some
new
advertisers
because
this
is
something
new
.
''

Mr.
Parks
of
Call
Interactive
says
TV
executives
are
considering
the
use
of
900
numbers
for
``
talk
shows
,
game
shows
,
news
and
opinion
surveys
.
''

Experts
are
predicting
a
big
influx
of
new
shows
in
1990
,
when
a
service
called
``
automatic
number
information
''
will
become
widely
available
.

This
service
identifies
each
caller
's
phone
number
,
and
it
can
be
used
to
generate
instant
mailing
lists
.

``
Hard
Copy

new
syndicated
tabloid
show
from
Paramount

.

``
For
a

we

ask

''
he
says
.

``
That
'll
save

''

But
Mr.
Monsky
sees
much
bigger
changes
ahead
.

``
These

he
says

Although
it
would
be
costly
to
shoot
multiple
versions
,
TV
programmers
could
let
audiences
vote
on
different

.

Fox
Broadcasting
experimented
with
this
concept
last
year
when
viewers
of
``

voted
on
whether

should
say
``
I
love
you
''
to

Someday
,
viewers
may
also
choose
different

``
A

Integrated
Resources
Inc.
,
the
troubled
financial-services
company
that
has
been
trying
to
sell
its
core
companies
to
restructure
debt
,
said
talks
with
a
potential
buyer
ended
.

Integrated
did
n't
identify
the
party
or
say
why
the
talks
failed
.

Last
week
another
potential
buyer
,
Whitehall
Financial
Group
--
which
had
agreed
in
August
to
purchase
most
of
Integrated
's
core
companies
for
$
310
million
--
ended
talks
with
Integrated
.

Integrated
said
that
it
would
continue
to
pursue
``
other
alternatives
''
to
sell
the
five
core
companies
and
that
a
group
of
senior
executives
plans
to
make
a
proposal
to
purchase
three
of
the
companies
--
Integrated
Resources
Equity
Corp.
,
Resources
Trust
Co.
and
Integrated
Resources
Asset
Management
Corp
.

A
price
was
n't
disclosed
.

Integrated
also
said
it
expects
to
report
a
second-quarter
loss
wider
than
the
earlier
estimate
of
about
$
600
million
.

The
company
did
n't
disclose
the
new
estimate
but
said
the
change
was
related
to
Integrated
's
failure
to
sell
its
core
businesses
,
as
well
as
``
other
events
,
''
which
it
did
n't
detail
,
that
occurred
after
its
announcement
last
week
that
it
was
in
talks
with
the
unidentified
prospective
buyer
.

Meanwhile
,
a
number
of
top
sales
producers
from
Integrated
Resources
Equity
will
meet
this
afternoon
in
Chicago
to
discuss
their
options
.

The
unit
is
a
loosely
constructed
group
of
about
3,900
independent
brokers
and
financial
planners
who
sell
insurance
,
annuities
,
limited
partnerships
,
mutual
funds
and
other
investments
for
Integrated
and
other
firms
.

The
sales
force
is
viewed
as
a
critical
asset
in
Integrated
's
attempt
to
sell
its
core
companies
.

Whitehall
cited
concerns
about
how
long
Integrated
would
be
able
to
hold
together
the
sales
force
as
one
reason
its
talks
with
Integrated
failed
.

In
composite
trading
on
the
New
York
Stock
Exchange
yesterday
,
Integrated
closed
at
$
1.25
a
share
,
down
25
cents
.

Integrated
has
been
struggling
to
avoid
a
bankruptcy-law
filing
since
June
,
when
it
failed
to
make
interest
payments
on
nearly
$
1
billion
of
debt
.

Integrated
senior
and
junior
creditors
are
owed
a
total
of
about
$
1.8
billion

AN
EARTHQUAKE
STRUCK
Northern
California
,
killing
more
than
50
people
.

The
violent
temblor
,
which
lasted
about
15
seconds
and
registered
6.9
on

,
also
caused
the
collapse
of
a

The
tremor
was
centered
near
Hollister
,
southeast
of
San
Francisco
,
and
was
felt
as
far
as
200
miles
away
.

Numerous
injuries
were
reported
.

Some
buildings
collapsed
,
gas
and
water
lines
ruptured
and
fires
raged

The
quake
,
which
also
caused

,
knocked
out
electricity

,
cracked
roadways
and

Senate
Democratic
leaders
said
they
had
enough
votes
to
defeat
a

rules
to
ensure
that
its
economy
becomes
as
open
as
the
other
industrialized
nations

Bush
assured
Roh
that

stand
by
its
security
commitments
``
as
long
as
there
is
a
threat
''
from

The

that
might

death
of

A

said
that

on
such
involvement
,
``
there
's
a
clarification

Moscow
has
n't
joined
efforts
,
led
by
Moslem

,
to
expel
Israel
from

was

its

offer
for
$
43.7
million

amount

%
senior

due

and
extended
the
offer
to
Oct.
27
from
Oct.
12
.

The
Hackensack
,
N.J.
,
company
said
holders
would
receive
for
each
$
1,000
face
amount
,
$
750

of
a
new

The
stock
of
UAL
Corp.
continued
to
be
pounded
amid
signs
that
British
Airways
may
balk
at
any
hasty
reformulation
of
the
aborted
$
6.79
billion
buy-out
of
United
Airlines
'
parent
.

UAL
stock
plummeted
a
further
$
24.875
to
$
198
on
volume
of
more
than
2.8
million
shares
in
New

Stock
Exchange
composite
trading
.

The
plunge
followed
a
drop
of
$
56.875
Monday
,
amid
indications
the
takeover
may
take
weeks
to
be
revived
.

The
stock
has
fallen
$
87.25
,
or
31
%
,
in
the
three
trading
days
since
announcement
of
the
collapse
of
the
$
300-a-share
takeover
jolted
the
entire
stock
market
into
its
second-worst
plunge
ever
.

``
This
is
a
total
bloodbath
''
for
takeover-stock
traders
,
one
investment
banker
said
.

Los
Angeles
financier
Marvin
Davis
,
who
put
United
in
play
with
a
$
5.4
billion
bid
two
months
ago
,
last
night
proffered
both
a
ray
of
hope
and
an
extra
element
of
uncertainty
by
saying
he
remains
interested
in
acquiring
UAL
.

But
he
dropped
his
earlier
$
300-a-share
back-up
bid
,
saying
he
must
first
explore
bank
financing
.

Even
as
Citicorp
and
Chase
Manhattan
Corp.
scrambled
to
line
up
bank
financing
for
a
revised
version
of
the
lapsed
labor-management
bid
,
British
Airways
,
a
15
%
partner
in
the
buying
group
,
indicated
it
wants
to
start
from
scratch
.

Its
partners
are
United
's
pilots
,
who
were
to
own
75
%
,
and
UAL
management
at
10
%
.

Adding
insult
to
injury
,
United
's
25,000-member
Machinists
'
union
,
which
helped
scuttle
financing
for
the
first
bid
,
yesterday
asked
UAL
Chairman
Stephen
Wolf
and
other
UAL
directors
to
resign
.

A
similar
demand
was
made
by
a
group
that
represents
some
of
United
's
26,000
noncontract
employees
.

John
Peterpaul
,
Machinists
union
general
vice
president
,
attacked
Mr.
Wolf
as
``
greedy
and
irresponsible
''
for
pursuing
the
buy-out
.

Although
Mr.
Wolf
and
John
Pope
,
UAL
's
chief
financial
officer
,
stood
to
pocket
$
114.3
million
for
stock
and
options
in
the
buy-out
,
UAL
executives
planned
to
reinvest
only
$
15
million
in
the
new
company
.

The
blue-collar
machinists
,
longtime
rivals
of
the
white-collar
pilots
,
say
the
buyout
would
load
the
company
with
debt
and
weaken
its
finances
.

Confusion
about
the
two
banks
'
hurried
efforts
to
round
up
financing
for
a
new
bid
that
the
UAL
board
has
n't
even
seen
yet
helped
send
UAL
stock
spiraling
downward
.

And
rumors
of
forced
selling
by
takeover-stock
traders
triggered
a
25-point
downdraft
in
the
Dow
Jones
Industrial
Average
around
11:15
a.m.
EDT
yesterday
.

Yesterday
's
selling
began
after
a
Japanese
news
agency
reported
that
Japanese
banks
,
which
balked
at
the
first
bid
,
were
ready
to
reject
a
revised
version
at
around
$
250
a
share
,
or
$
5.65
billion
.

Several
reports
as
the
day
progressed
gave
vague
or
conflicting
indications
about
whether
banks
would
sign
up
.

Citicorp
,
for
example
,
said
only
that
it
had
``
expressions
of
interest
of
a
transaction
from
both
the
borrowers
and
the
banks
,
''
but
did
n't
have
an
agreement
.

Late
in
the
day
,
Mr.
Wolf
issued
a
onepage
statement
calling
Mr.
Peterpaul
's
blast
``
divisive
and
uncalled
for
.
''

But
he
gave
few
details
on
the
progress
toward
a
new
bid
,
saying
only
,
``
We
are
working
toward
a
revised
proposal
for
majority
employee
ownership
.
''

Meanwhile
,
in
another
sign
that
a
new
bid
is
n't
imminent
,
it
was
learned
that
the
UAL
board
held
a
telephone
meeting
Monday
to
hear
an
update
on
the
situation
,
but
that
a
formal
board
meeting
is
n't
likely
to
be
convened
until
early
next
week
.

In
London
,
British
Airways
Chairman
Lord
King
was
quoted
in
the
Times
as
declaring
he
is
``
not
prepared
to
take
my
shareholders
into
a
hasty
deal
.
''

Observers
said
it
appeared
that
British
Air
was
angered
at
the
way
the
bid
has
degenerated
into
confusion
,
as
well
as
by
the
banks
'
effort
to
round
up
financing
for
what
one
called
``
a
deal
that
is
n't
a
deal
.
''

The
effort
to
revive
the
bid
was
complicated
by
the
unwieldy
nature
of
the
three-party
buying
group
.

The
pilots
were
meeting
outside
Chicago
yesterday
.

But
British
Air
,
which
was
to
have
supplied
$
750
million
out
of
$
965
million
in
equity
financing
,
apparently
was
n't
involved
in
the
second
proposal
and
could
well
reject
it
even
if
banks
obtain
financing
.

A
group
of
United
's
noncontract
employees
said
in
a
statement
,
``
The
fact
that
Wolf
and
other
officers
were
going
to
line
their
pockets
with
literally
millions
of
dollars
while
instituting
severe
pay
cuts
on
the
nonunion
employees
of
United
is
not
only
deplorable
but
inexcusable
.
''

The
machinists
also
asked
for
an
investigation
by
the
Securities
and
Exchange
Commission
into
possible
securities-law
violations
in
the
original
bid
for
UAL
by
Mr.
Davis
,
as
well
as
in
the
response
by
UAL
.

Last
week
,
just
before
the
bank
commitments
were
due
,
the
union
asked
the
U.S.
Labor
Department
to
study
whether
the
bid
violated
legal
standards
of
fairness
governing
employee
investment
funds
.

In
his
statement
,
Mr.
Wolf
said
,
``
We
continue
to
believe
our
approach
is
sound
,
and
that
it
is
far
better
for
all
employees
than
the
alternative
of
having
an
outsider
own
the
company
with
employees
paying
for
it
just
the
same
.
''

Mr.
Wolf
has
eschewed
merger
advice
from
a
major
Wall
Street
securities
firm
,
relying
instead
only
on
a
takeover
lawyer
,
Peter
Atkins
of
Skadden
Arps
Slate
Meagher
&
Flom
.

The
huge
drop
in
UAL
stock
prompted
one
takeover
stock
trader
,
George
Kellner
,
managing
partner
of
Kellner
,
DiLeo
&
Co.
,
to
deny
publicly
rumors
that
his
firm
was
going
out
of
business
.

Mr.
Kellner
said
that
despite
losses
on
UAL
stock
,
his
firm
's
health
is
``
excellent
.
''

The
stock
's
decline
also
has
left
the
UAL
board
in
a
quandary
.

Although
it
may
not
be
legally
obligated
to
sell
the
company
if
the
buy-out
group
ca
n't
revive
its
bid
,
it
may
have
to
explore
alternatives
if
the
buyers
come
back
with
a
bid
much
lower
than
the
group
's
original
$
300-a-share
proposal
.

At
a
meeting
Sept.
1
to
consider
the
labor-management
bid
,
the
board
also
was
informed
by
its
investment
adviser
,
First
Boston
Corp.
,
of
interest
expressed
by
buy-out
funds
including
Kohlberg
Kravis
Roberts
&
Co.
and
Forstmann
Little
&
Co.
,
as
well
as
by
Robert
Bass
,
Morgan
Stanley
's
buy-out
fund
,
and
Pan
Am
Corp
.

The
takeover-stock
traders
were
hoping
that
Mr.
Davis
or
one
of
the
other
interested
parties
might
re-emerge
with
the
situation
in
disarray
,
or
that
the
board
might
consider
a
recapitalization
.

Meanwhile
,
Japanese
bankers
said
they
were
still
hesitant
about
accepting
Citicorp
's
latest
proposal
.

Macmillan
Inc.
said
it
plans
a
public
offering
of
8.4
million
shares
of
its
Berlitz
International
Inc.
unit
at
$
19
to
$
21
a
share
.

The
offering
for
the
language
school
unit
was
announced
by
Robert
Maxwell
,
chairman
and
chief
executive
officer
of
London-based
Maxwell
Communication
Corp.
,
which
owns
Macmillan
.

After
the
offering
is
completed
,
Macmillan
will
own
about
56
%
of
the
Berlitz
common
stock
outstanding
.

Five
million
shares
will
be
offered
in
the
U.S.
,
and
3.4
million
additional
shares
will
be
offered
in
concurrent
international
offerings
outside
the
U.S.
.

Goldman
,
Sachs
&
Co.
will
manage
the
offering
.

Macmillan
said
Berlitz
intends
to
pay
quarterly
dividends
on
the
stock
.

The
company
said
it
expects
to
pay
the
first
dividend
,
of
12.5
cents
a
share
,
in
the
1990
first
quarter
.

Berlitz
will
borrow
an
amount
equal
to
its
expected
net
proceeds
from
the
offerings
,
plus
$
50
million
,
in
connection
with
a
credit
agreement
with
lenders
.

The
total
borrowing
will
be
about
$
208
million
,
the
company
said
.

Proceeds
from
the
borrowings
under
the
credit
agreement
will
be
used
to
pay
an
$
80
million
cash
dividend
to
Macmillan
and
to
lend
the
remainder
of
about
$
128
million
to
Maxwell
Communications
in
connection
with
a
promissory
note
.

Proceeds
from
the
offering
will
be
used
to
repay
borrowings
under
the
short-term
parts
of
a
credit
agreement
.

Berlitz
,
which
is
based
in
Princeton
,
N.J.
,
provides
language
instruction
and
translation
services
through
more
than
260
language
centers
in
25
countries
.

In
the
past
five
years
,
more
than
68
%
of
its
sales
have
been
outside
the
U.S.
.

Macmillan
has
owned
Berlitz
since
1966
.

In
the
first
six
months
of
this
year
,
Berlitz
posted
net
income
of
$
7.6
million
on
sales
of
$
106.2
million
,
compared
with
net
income
of
$
8.2
million
on
sales
of
$
90.6
million
.

Right
away
you
notice
the
following
things
about
a
Philip
Glass
concert
.

It
attracts
people
with
funny
hair
(
or
with
no
hair
--
in
front
of
me
a
girl
with
spiked
locks
sat
beside
a
boy
who
had
shaved
his
)
.

Whoever
constitute
the
local
Left
Bank
come
out
in
force
,
dressed
in
black
,
along
with
a
smattering
of
yuppies
who
want
to
be
on
the
cutting
edge
.

People
in
Glass
houses
tend
to
look
stoned
.

And
,
if
still
conscious
at
the
evening
's
end
,
you
notice
something
else
:
The
audience
,
at
first
entranced
and
hypnotized
by
the
music
,
releases
its
pent-up
feelings
in
collective
gratitude
.

Currently
in
the
middle
of
a
four-week
,
20-city
tour
as
a
solo
pianist
,
Mr.
Glass
has
left
behind
his
synthesizers
,
equipment
and
collaborators
in
favor
of
going
it
alone
.

He
sits
down
at
the
piano
and
plays
.

And
plays
.

Either
one
likes
it
or
one
does
n't
.

The
typical
Glass
audience
,
which
is
more
likely
to
be
composed
of
music
students
than
their
teachers
,
certainly
does
.

The
work
,
though
,
sounds
like
Muzak
for
spaceships
.

Philip
Glass
is
the
emperor
,
and
his
music
the
new
clothes
,
of
the
avant-garde
.

His
success
is
easy
to
understand
.

Softly
introducing
and
explaining
his
pieces
,
Mr.
Glass
looks
and
sounds
more
like
a
shaggy
poet
describing
his
work
than
a
classical
pianist
playing
a
recital
.

The
piano
compositions
,
which
have
been
labeled
variously
as
minimalist
,
Oriental
,
repetitive
,
cyclical
,
monophonic
and
hypnotic
,
are
relentlessly
tonal
(
therefore
unthreatening
)
,
unvaryingly
rhythmic
(
therefore
soporific
)
,
and
unflaggingly
harmonious
but
unmelodic
(
therefore
both
pretty
and
unconventional
)
.

It
is
music
for
people
who
want
to
hear
something
different
but
do
n't
want
to
work
especially
hard
at
the
task
.

It
is
E-Z
listening
for
the
now
generation
.

Mr.
Glass
has
inverted
the
famous
modernist
dictum
``
less
is
more
.
''

His
more
is
always
less
.

Far
from
being
minimalist
,
the
music
unabatingly
torments
us
with
apparent
novelties
not
so
cleverly
disguised
in
the
simplicities
of
4\/4
time
,
octave
intervals
,
and
ragtime
or
gospel
chord
progressions
.

But
the
music
has
its
charm
,
and
Mr.
Glass
has
constructed
his
solo
program
around
a
move
from
the
simple
to
the
relatively
complex
.

``
Opening
''
(
1981
)
,
from
Glassworks
,
introduces
the
audience
to
the
Glass
technique
:
Never
straying
too
far
from
the
piano
's
center
,
Mr.
Glass
works
in
the
two
octaves
on
either
side
of
middle
C
,
and
his
fingers
seldom
leave
the
keys
.

There
is
a
recognizable
musical
style
here
,
but
not
a
particular
performance
style
.

The
music
is
not
especially
pianistic
;
indeed
,
it
's
hard
to
imagine
a
bad
performance
of
it
.

Nothing
bravura
,
no
arpeggios
,
no
ticklish
fingering
problems
challenge
the
performer
.

We
hear
,
we
may
think
,
inner
voices
,
but
they
all
seem
to
be
saying
the
same
thing
.

With
``
Planet
News
,
''
music
meant
to
accompany
readings
of
Allen
Ginsberg
's
``
Wichita
Vortex
Sutra
,
''
Mr.
Glass
gets
going
.

His
hands
sit
farther
apart
on
the
keyboard
.

Seventh
chords
make
you
feel
as
though
he
may
break
into
a
(
very
slow
)
improvisatory
riff
.

The
chords
modulate
,
but
there
is
little
filigree
even
though
his
fingers
begin
to
wander
over
more
of
the
keys
.

Contrasts
predictably
accumulate
:
First
the
music
is
loud
,
then
it
becomes
soft
,
then
(
you
realize
)
it
becomes
louder
again
.

``
The
Fourth
Knee
Play
,
''
an
interlude
from
``
Einstein
on
the
Beach
,
''
is
like
a
toccata
but
it
does
n't
seem
to
move
much
beyond
its
left-hand
ground
in
``
Three
Blind
Mice
.
''

When
Mr.
Glass
decides
to
get
really
fancy
,
he
crosses
his
hands
and
hits
a
resonant
bass
note
with
his
right
hand
.

He
does
this
in
at
least
three
of
his
solo
pieces
.

You
might
call
it
a
leitmotif
or
a
virtuoso
accomplishment
.

In
``
Mad
Rush
,
''
which
came
from
a
commission
to
write
a
piece
of
indeterminate
length
(
Mr.
Glass
charmingly
,
and
tellingly
,
confessed
that
``
this
was
no
problem
for
me
''
)
,
an
A
section
alternates
with
a
B
section
several
times
before
the
piece
ends
unresolved
.

Not
only
is
the
typical
Glasswork
open-ended
,
it
is
also
often
multiple
in
its
context
(
s
)
.

``
Mad
Rush
''
began
its
life
as
the
accompaniment
to
the
Dalai
Lama
's
first
public
address
in
the
U.S.
,
when
Mr.
Glass
played
it
on
the
organ
at
New
York
's
Cathedral
of
St.
John
the
Divine
.

Later
it
was
performed
on
Radio
Bremen
in
Germany
,
and
then
Lucinda
Childs
took
it
for
one
of
her
dance
pieces
.

The
point
is
that
any
piece
can
be
used
as
background
music
for
virtually
anything
.

The
evening
ended
with
Mr.
Glass
's
``
Metamorphosis
,
''
another
multiple
work
.

Parts
1
,
2
,
and
5
come
from
the
soundtrack
of
Errol
Morris
's
acclaimed
film
,
``
The
Thin
Blue
Line
,
''
and
the
two
other
parts
from
incidental
music
to
two
separate
dramatizations
of
the
Kafka
story
of
the
same
name
.

When
used
as
background
in
this
way
,
the
music
has
an
appropriate
eeriness
,
as
when
a
two-note
phrase
,
a
descending
minor
third
,
accompanies
the
seemingly
endless
litany
of
reports
,
interviews
and
confessions
of
witnesses
in
the
Morris
film
.

Served
up
as
a
solo
,
however
,
the
music
lacks
the
resonance
provided
by
a
context
within
another
medium
.

Admirers
of
Mr.
Glass
may
agree
with
the
critic
Richard
Kostelanetz
's
sense
that
the
1974
``
Music
in
Twelve
Parts
''
is
as
encyclopedic
and
weighty
as
``
The
Well-Tempered
Clavier
.
''

But
while
making
the
obvious
point
that
both
composers
develop
variations
from
themes
,
this
comparison
ignores
the
intensely
claustrophobic
nature
of
Mr.
Glass
's
music
.

Its
supposedly
austere
minimalism
overlays
a
bombast
that
makes
one
yearn
for
the
astringency
of
neoclassical
Stravinsky
,
the
genuinely
radical
minimalism
of
Berg
and
Webern
,
and
what
in
retrospect
even
seems
like
concision
in
Mahler
.

Mr.
Spiegelman
is
professor
of
English
at
Southern
Methodist
University
and
editor
of
the
Southwest
Review
.

Honeywell
Inc.
said
it
hopes
to
complete
shortly
the
first
of
two
sales
of
shares
in
its
Japanese
joint
venture
,
Yamatake-Honeywell
,
for
about
$
280
million
.

The
company
would
n't
disclose
the
buyer
of
the
initial
16
%
stake
.

Proceeds
of
the
sale
,
expected
to
be
completed
next
week
,
would
be
used
to
repurchase
as
many
as
10
million
shares
of
Honeywell
stock
,
the
company
said
.

Honeywell
said
it
is
negotiating
the
sale
of
a
second
stake
in
Yamatake-Honeywell
,
but
indicated
it
intends
to
hold
at
least
20
%
of
the
joint
venture
's
stock
long
term
.

A
20
%
stake
would
allow
Honeywell
to
include
Yamatake
earnings
in
its
results
.

Honeywell
previously
said
it
intended
to
reduce
its
holding
in
the
Japanese
concern
as
part
of
a
restructuring
plan
which
also
calls
for
a
reduction
of
dependence
on
weapons
sales
.

Yesterday
a
spokeswoman
said
the
company
was
``
pleased
with
our
progress
''
in
that
regard
and
``
hopes
to
provide
additional
details
soon
.
''

Honeywell
said
its
Defense
and
Marine
Systems
group
incurred
delays
in
shipping
some
undisclosed
contracts
during
the
third
quarter
,
resulting
in
lower
operating
profit
for
that
business
.

Overall
,
Honeywell
reported
earnings
of
$
74.4
million
,
or
$
1.73
a
share
,
for
the
three
months
ended
Oct.
1
compared
with
a
loss
of
$
41.4
million
,
or
98
cents
a
share
,
a
year
earlier
.

The
previous
period
's
results
included
a
$
108
million
pretax
charge
related
to
unrecoverable
contract
costs
and
a
$
12.3
million
pretax
gain
on
real
estate
sales
.

Sales
for
the
latest
quarter
were
flat
,
at
$
1.72
billion
.

For
the
nine
months
,
Honeywell
reported
earnings
of
$
212.1
million
,
or
$
4.92
a
share
,
compared
with
earnings
of
$
47.9
million
,
or
$
1.13
a
share
,
a
year
earlier
.

Sales
declined
slightly
to
$
5.17
billion
.

Once
again
,
your
editorial
page
misstates
the
law
to
conform
to
your
almost
beatific
misperceptions
.

In
an
excursus
of
little
relevance
to
his
central
point
about
private
enforcement
suits
by
environmental
groups
,
Michael
S.
Greve
informs
your
readers
,
``
...
the
Clean
Water
Act
is
written
upon
the
presumption
--
the
pretense
,
rather
--
that
nothing
but
zero
risk
will
do
;
it
establishes
a
legal
standard
of
zero
discharge
''
(
``
Congress's
Environmental
Buccaneers
,
''
Sept.
18
)
.

This
statement
surely
buttresses
your
editorial
viewpoint
that
environmental
protection
is
generally
silly
or
excessive
,
but
it
is
simply
wrong
.

The
Clean
Water
Act
contains
no
``
legal
standard
''
of
zero
discharge
.

It
requires
that
``
discharges
of
pollutants
''
into
the
``
waters
of
the
United
States
''
be
authorized
by
permits
that
reflect
the
effluent
limitations
developed
under
section
301
.

Whatever
may
be
the
problems
with
this
system
,
it
scarcely
reflects
``
zero
risk
''
or
``
zero
discharge
.
''

Perhaps
Mr.
Greve
was
confused
by
Congress
's
meaningless
statement
of
``
the
national
goal
''
in
section
101
,
which
indeed
calls
for
the
elimination
of
discharges
--
by
1985
,
no
less
.

This
fatuous
statement
was
not
taken
seriously
when
enacted
in
1972
,
and
should
not
now
be
confused
with
the
operative
provisions
of
the
statute
.

Thus
,
you
do
the
public
a
great
disservice
when
Mr.
Greve
suggests
,
even
facetiously
,
that
the
Clean
Water
Act
prohibits
the
preparation
of
a
scotch
and
water
;
your
tippling
readers
may
be
led
to
believe
that
nothing
but
chance
or
oversight
protects
them
,
as
they
cower
in
the
night
with
their
scotch
and
waters
,
from
the
hairyknuckled
knock
of
the
Sierra
Club
at
their
doors
.

National
Geographic
,
the
sixth-largest
U.S.
magazine
,
is
attracting
more
readers
than
ever
and
offers
the
glossy
,
high-toned
pages
that
upscale
advertisers
love
.

So
why
did
advertising
pages
plunge
by
almost
10
%
and
ad
revenue
by
7.2
%
in
the
first
half
?

To
hear
advertisers
tell
it
,
the
magazine
just
has
n't
kept
up
with
the
times
.

Despite
renewed
interest
by
the
public
in
such
topics
as
the
environment
and
the
Third
World
,
it
has
n't
been
able
to
shake
its
reputation
as
a
magazine
boys
like
to
flip
through
in
search
of
topless
tribe
women
.

Worse
,
it
lagged
behind
competitors
in
offering
now-standard
gimmicks
,
from
regional
editions
to
discounts
for
frequent
advertisers
.

But
now
,
the
magazine
is
attempting
to
fight
back
,
with
an
ambitious
plan
including
a
revamped
sales
strategy
and
a
surprisingly
aggressive
ad
campaign
.

Advertisers
do
n't
think
of
the
magazine
first
,
says
Joan
McCraw
,
who
joined
in
April
as
national
advertising
director
.

``
What
we
want
to
do
is
take
a
more
aggressive
stance
.

People
did
n't
believe
we
were
in
tune
with
the
marketplace
,
and
in
many
ways
we
were
n't
.
''

The
101-year-old
magazine
has
never
had
to
woo
advertisers
with
quite
so
much
fervor
before
.

It
largely
rested
on
its
hard-to-fault
demographics
:
10.8
million
subscribers
in
the
first
half
,
up
from
10.5
million
a
year
ago
;
an
average
age
of
42
for
readers
--
at
the
height
of
their
consuming
years
;
loyalty
to
the
tune
of
an
85
%
average
subscription
renewal
rate
.

The
magazine
had
its
best
year
yet
in
1988
,
when
it
celebrated
its
centennial
and
racked
up
a
17
%
gain
in
ad
pages
,
to
283
.

But
this
year
,
when
the
hullabaloo
surrounding
its
centennial
died
,
so
too
did
some
advertiser
interest
.

The
reason
,
ad
executives
say
,
is
that
the
entire
magazine
business
has
been
soft
--
and
National
Geographic
has
some
quirks
that
make
it
especially
unattractive
during
a
soft
market
.

Perhaps
the
biggest
of
those
factors
is
its
high
ad
prices
--
$
130,000
for
a
four-color
page
,
vs.
$
47,000
for
the
Smithsonian
,
a
comparable
publication
with
a
far
smaller
circulation
.

When
ad
dollars
are
tight
,
the
high
page
cost
is
a
major
deterrent
for
advertisers
,
who
generally
want
to
appear
regularly
in
a
publication
or
not
at
all
.

Even
though
National
Geographic
offers
far
more
readers
than
does
a
magazine
like
Smithsonian
,
``
the
page
costs
you
an
arm
and
a
leg
to
develop
any
frequency
,
''
says
Harry
Glass
,
New
York
media
manager
for
Bozell
Inc
.

To
combat
that
problem
,
National
Geographic
,
like
other
magazines
,
began
offering
regional
editions
allowing
advertisers
to
appear
in
only
a
portion
of
its
magazines
--
for
example
,
ads
can
run
only
in
the
magazines
sent
to
subscribers
in
the
largest
25
markets
.

But
the
magazine
was
slower
than
its
competitors
to
come
up
with
its
regional
editions
,
and
until
last
year
offered
fewer
of
them
than
did
competitors
.

Time
magazine
,
for
example
,
has
more
than
100
separate
editions
going
to
different
regions
,
top
management
,
and
other
groups
.

Another
sticking
point
for
advertisers
was
National
Geographic
's
tradition
of
lumping
its
ads
together
,
usually
at
the
beginning
or
end
of
the
magazine
,
rather
than
spreading
ads
out
among
its
articles
,
as
most
magazines
do
.

And
National
Geographic
's
smaller-than-average
size
means
extra
production
costs
for
advertisers
.

But
Ms.
McCraw
says
the
magazine
is
fighting
back
.

It
now
offers
30
regional
editions
,
it
very
recently
began
running
ads
adjacent
to
articles
,
and
it
has
been
beefing
up
its
sales
force
.

And
it
just
launched
a
promotional
campaign
to
tell
chief
executives
,
marketing
directors
,
and
media
executives
just
that
.

The
centerpiece
of
the
promotion
is
its
new
ad
campaign
,
into
which
the
magazine
will
pour
about
$
500,000
,
mostly
in
the
next
few
weeks
.

The
campaign
,
created
by
Omnicom
Group
's
DDB
Needham
agency
,
takes
advantage
of
the
eye-catching
photography
that
National
Geographic
is
known
for
.

In
one
ad
,
a
photo
of
the
interior
of
the
Sainte-Chapelle
in
Paris
is
paired
with
the
headline
,
``
The
only
book
more
respected
than
ours
does
n't
accept
advertising
.
''

Another
ad
pictures
a
tree
ant
,
magnified
80
times
,
with
the
headline
,
``
For
impact
far
beyond
your
size
consider
our
regional
editions
.
''

Ms.
McCraw
says
she
wants
the
campaign
to
help
attract
advertisers
in
10
categories
,
including
corporate
,
financial
services
,
consumer
electronics
,
insurance
and
food
.

Her
goal
:
to
top
300
ad
pages
in
1990
,
up
from
about
274
this
year
.

Whether
she
can
meet
that
ambitious
goal
is
still
far
from
certain
.

``
The
ad
campaign
is
meant
to
contemporize
the
thought
of
National
Geographic
,
''
she
says
.

``
We
want
it
to
be
a
'90s
kind
of
image
.

The
Commodity
Futures
Trading
Commission
plans
to
restrict
dual
trading
on
commodity
exchanges
,
a
move
almost
certain
to
infuriate
exchange
officials
and
traders
.

The
CFTC
said
it
will
propose
the
restrictions
after
the
release
of
a
study
that
shows
little
economic
benefit
resulting
from
dual
trading
and
cites
``
problems
''
associated
with
the
practice
.

Dual
trading
gives
an
exchange
trader
the
right
to
trade
both
for
his
own
account
and
for
customers
.

The
issue
exploded
this
year
after
a
Federal
Bureau
of
Investigation
operation
led
to
charges
of
widespread
trading
abuses
at
the
Chicago
Board
of
Trade
and
Chicago
Mercantile
Exchange
.

While
not
specifically
mentioned
in
the
FBI
charges
,
dual
trading
became
a
focus
of
attempts
to
tighten
industry
regulations
.

Critics
contend
that
traders
were
putting
buying
or
selling
for
their
own
accounts
ahead
of
other
traders
'
customer
orders
.

Traders
are
likely
to
oppose
such
restrictions
because
dual
trading
provides
a
way
to
make
money
in
slower
markets
where
there
is
a
shortage
of
customer
orders
.

The
exchanges
contend
that
dual
trading
improves
liquidity
in
the
markets
because
traders
can
buy
or
sell
even
when
they
do
n't
have
a
customer
order
in
hand
.

The
exchanges
say
liquidity
becomes
a
severe
problem
for
thinly
traded
contracts
such
as
those
with
a
long
time
remaining
before
expiration
.

The
CFTC
may
take
those
arguments
into
account
by
allowing
exceptions
to
its
restrictions
.

The
agency
did
n't
cite
specific
situations
where
dual
trading
might
be
allowed
,
but
smaller
exchanges
or
contracts
that
need
additional
liquidity
are
expected
to
be
among
them
.

Wendy
Gramm
,
the
agency
's
chairman
,
told
the
Senate
Agriculture
Committee
that
she
expects
the
study
to
be
released
within
two
weeks
and
the
rule
changes
to
be
completed
by
Thanksgiving
.

The
study
,
by
the
CFTC
's
division
of
economic
analysis
,
shows
that
``
a
trade
is
a
trade
,
''
a
member
of
the
study
team
said
.

Whether
a
trade
is
done
on
a
dual
or
non-dual
basis
,
the
member
said
,
``
does
n't
seem
to
have
much
economic
impact
.
''

Currently
,
most
traders
on
commodity
exchanges
specialize
in
trading
either
for
customer
accounts
,
which
makes
them
brokers
,
or
for
their
own
accounts
as
socalled
locals
.

``
The
tests
indicate
that
dual
and
non-dual
traders
are
similar
in
terms
of
the
trade
executions
and
liquidity
they
provide
to
the
market
,
''
Mrs.
Gramm
told
the
Senate
panel
.

Members
of
Congress
have
proposed
restricting
dual
trading
in
bills
to
reauthorize
CFTC
operations
.

The
House
's
bill
would
prohibit
dual
trading
in
markets
with
daily
average
volume
of
7,000
contracts
or
more
,
comprising
those
considered
too
difficult
to
track
without
a
sophisticated
computer
system
.

The
Senate
bill
would
force
the
CFTC
to
suspend
dual
trading
if
an
exchange
ca
n't
show
that
its
oversight
system
can
detect
dual-trading
abuses
.

So
far
,
one
test
of
restricting
dual
trading
has
worked
well
.

The
Chicago
Merc
banned
dual
trading
in
its
Standard
&
Poor
's
500-stock
index
futures
pit
in
1987
.

Under
the
rules
,
traders
decide
before
a
session
begins
whether
they
will
trade
for
their
own
account
or
for
customers
.

Traders
who
stand
on
the
pit
's
top
step
,
where
most
customer
orders
are
executed
,
ca
n't
trade
for
themselves
.

A
Merc
spokesman
said
the
plan
has
n't
made
much
difference
in
liquidity
in
the
pit
.

``
It
's
too
soon
to
tell
...
but
people
do
n't
seem
to
be
unhappy
with
it
,
''
he
said
.

He
said
he
would
n't
comment
on
the
CFTC
plan
until
the
exchange
has
seen
the
full
proposal
.

But
at
a
meeting
last
week
,
Tom
Donovan
,
the
Board
of
Trade
's
president
,
told
commodity
lawyers
:
``
Dual
trading
is
definitely
worth
saving
.

It
adds
something
to
the
market
.

Japanese
Firms
Push
Posh
Car
Showrooms

JAPANESE
luxury-car
makers
are
trying
to
set
strict
design
standards
for
their
dealerships
.

But
some
dealers
are
negotiating
looser
terms
,
while
others
decline
to
deal
at
all
.

Nissan
Motor
Co.
's
Infiniti
division
likes
to
insist
that
every
dealer
construct
and
furnish
a
building
in
a
Japanese
style
.

Specifications
include
a
polished
bronze
sculpture
at
the
center
of
each
showroom
and
a
tile
bridge
spanning
a
stream
that
flows
into
the
building
from
outside
.

``
Infiniti
has
it
down
to
the
ashtrays
,
''
says
Jay
Ferron
,
a
partner
at
J.D.
Power
&
Associates
,
an
auto
research
firm
.

Toyota
Motor
Corp.
's
Lexus
division
also
provides
specifications
.

But
only
two-thirds
of
Lexus
dealers
are
constructing
new
buildings
according
to
the
Lexus
specs
.

Some
are
even
coming
up
with
their
own
novel
designs
.

In
Louisville
,
Ky.
,
for
example
,
David
Peterson
has
built
a
Lexus
dealership
with
the
showroom
on
the
second
floor
.

Yet
some
dealers
have
turned
down
Infiniti
or
Lexus
franchises
because
they
were
unwilling
or
unable
to
meet
the
design
requirements
.

Lee
Seidman
of
Cleveland
says
Infiniti
``
was
a
bear
on
interiors
''
but
at
least
let
him
retrofit
an
existing
building
--
without
the
stream
.

Mr.
Seidman
says
he
turned
down
a
Lexus
franchise
in
part
because
``
the
building
was
gorgeous
but
very
expensive
.
''

To
head
off
arguments
,
Infiniti
offers
dealers
cash
bonuses
and
low-interest
construction
loans
.

Dictation
Device
's
Saga
Plays
Back
a
Lesson

PRODUCTS
DON'T
have
to
be
first
to
be
winners
.

That
's
the
lesson
offered
through
one
case
study
featured
in
a
design
exhibit
.

Dictaphone
Corp.
was
caught
off
guard
in
1974
when
its
main
competitor
,
Lanier
Office
Products
of
Japan
,
introduced
a
microcassette
dictation
recorder
half
the
size
of
standard
cassette
devices
.

Blocked
by
patent
protection
from
following
suit
,
Dictaphone
decided
to
go
a
step
further
and
cut
the
cassette
in
half
again
--
down
to
the
length
of
a
paperclip
.

By
1979
,
designers
and
engineers
at
Dictaphone
,
a
Pitney
Bowes
subsidiary
,
had
produced
a
working
model
of
a
``
picocassette
''
recorder
.

By
1982
,
however
,
the
patent
status
of
the
Lanier
microcassette
had
changed
,
permitting
Dictaphone
to
develop
its
own
competitive
micro
system
,
which
it
did
.

Marketing
and
sales
departments
then
urged
abandonment
of
the
pico
project
.

But
others
said
pico
should
proceed
.

Both
were
right
.

Dictaphone
went
ahead
and
introduced
the
pico
in
1985
,
but
it
has
n't
sold
well
.

To
date
,
says
Emil
Jachmann
,
a
Dictaphone
vice
president
,
it
has
``
broken
even
or
shown
a
small
loss
.
''

Nevertheless
,
the
device
has
been
successful
in
other
ways
.

It
helped
Dictaphone
attract
better
engineers
,
and
it
provided
new
technology
for
other
company
products
.

The
picocassette
recorder
also
helped
transform
the
company
's
reputation
from
follower
to
leading-edge
innovator
.

``
It
gave
me
great
pride
to
see
the
inventor
of
the
microcassette
in
Japan
look
at
the
pico
and
shake
his
head
and
say
`
unbelievable
,
'
''
says
Mr.
Jachmann
.

Dictaphone
's
picocassette
recorder
is
one
of
13
case
studies
in
the
TRIAD
Design
Project
,
sponsored
by
the
Design
Management
Institute
of
Boston
and
Harvard
Business
School
.

The
studies
are
on
exhibit
at
Harvard
this
month
and
will
travel
to
Chicago
's
Institute
of

and
the
University

A
Rake
's
Progress
Means
Branching
Out

ONE
DAY
Carl
Barrett
of
Mobile
,
Ala.
,
was
raking
some
sycamore
leaves
,
but
the
rake
kept
riding
up
over
the
piles
.

The
harder
he
tried
to
push
them
into
large
piles
,
the
closer
he
came
to
breaking
the
rake
and
straining
his
back
.

So
Mr.
Barrett
,
then
vice
president
of
the
Alabama
Steamship
Association
,
took
a
steel-toothed
garden
rake
and
taped
it
to
the
underside
of
a
leaf
rake
about
nine
inches
up
.

His
crude
device
worked
:
The
lower
teeth
gathered
the
leaves
into
a
pile
,
while
the
higher
,
harder
teeth
moved
the
top
of
the
pile
.

Now
incorporated
into
a
polypropylene
rake
,
the
four-inch
prongs
,
or
``
wonderbars
,
''
also
are
supposed
to
aid
in
picking
up
leaves
.

One
customer
,
Donald
Blaggs
of
Mobile
,
says
the
Barrett
Rake
allowed
him
to
do
his
lawn
in
2
1\/2
hours
,
two
hours
less
than
usual
.

But
other
rake
makers
have
their
doubts
.

Richard
Mason
,
president
of
Ames
Co.
in
Parkersburg
,
W.
Va.
,
says
the
Barrett
rake
``
makes
sense
,
''
but
it
would
be
``
tough
''
to
explain
to
consumers
.

John
Stoner
,
marketing
director
for
True
Temper
Corp.
,
a
subsidiary
of
Black
&
Decker
,
says
people
do
n't
want
to
move
a
leaf
pile
.

``
They
either
pick
it
up
,
''
he
says
,
``
or
they
start
pulling
from
a
fresh
direction
.

of
a
``
W
,
''
are
attached
to
the
bottom
of
the
box
spring
in
a
recessed
position
...
.

Nearly
half
of
U.S.
consumers
say
they
'll
pay
up
to
5
%
more
for
packaging
that
can
be
recycled
or
is
biodegradable
,
according
to
a
survey
commissioned
by
the
Michael
Peters
Group
,
a
design
consultant
.

The
Pentagon
is
a
haunted
house
.

Living
there
for
six
years
was
really
scary
.

The
ghosts
of
the
past
are
everywhere
:
They
are
kept
at
bay
only
by
feeding
them
vast
quantities
of
our
defense
budget
.

Some
can
be
bought
off
relatively
cheaply
.

During
the
Korean
War
,
Gen.
Douglas
MacArthur
demanded
and
got
,
in
addition
to
his
U.N.
command
in
Korea
,
his
own
naval
command
in
Japan
,
NavforJapan
.

Those
obsolete
operations
cost
less
than
$
2
billion
a
year
,
and
keep
Mac
's
ghost
quiet
.

That
's
about
all
it
costs
to
appease
Adm.
Erich
Raeder
's
ghost
.

In
1941
,
Raeder
and
the
German
navy
threatened
to
attack
the
Panama
Canal
,
so
we
created
the
Southern
Command
in
Panama
.

The
Southern
Command
has
grown
even
bigger
since
the
war
because
Raeder
's
ghost
sometimes
runs
through
the
E
ring
dressed
like
Gen.
Noriega
.

The
Command
's
huge
bureaucracy
is
needed
to
analyze
whether
leaders
of
coups
against
Gen.
Noriega
meet
the
War
Powers
Act
's
six
points
,
Cap
Weinberger
's
seven
points
,
the
Intelligence
Committee
's
32
points
and
Woodrow
Wilson
's
14
points
necessary
to
justify
U.S.
support
.

So
far
no
one
has
.

The
ghost
of
the
Soviet
brigade
discovered
in
Cuba
back
in
the
'70s
costs
just
a
few
hundred
million
:
the
price
of
the
Caribbean
Command
in
Key
West
that
President
Carter
created
in
1980
.

The
brigade
has
n't
been
heard
from
since
,
but
we
keep
the
staff
around
just
in
case
.

George
Marshall
's
ghost
is
much
more
difficult
to
keep
happy
.

We
keep
a
lot
of
shrines
to
him
around
the
Pentagon
:
statues
,
busts
,
relics
and
such
.

The
Army
headquarters
on
the
third
deck
of
the
Pentagon
used
to
burn
a
lot
of
incense
to
him
,
but
the
Navy
headquarters
on
the
fourth
deck
made
them
stop
it
.

You
see
,
Marshall
had
this
thing
about
the
Navy
and
the
Marines
--
he
wanted
to
make
them
part
of
the
Army
but
Secretary
of
the
Navy
James
Forrestal
blocked
him
.

Now
his
ghost
wo
n't
let
up
till
it
's
done
.

To
keep
him
quiet
we
invent
a
new
unified
command
every
year
or
so
run
by
the
Army
or
the
Air
Force
and
put
more
of
the
Navy
and
Marines
under
it
.

But
we
still
hear
him
moaning
at
night
because
the
Navy
has
a
few
ships
left
,
and
to
satisfy
him
the
Navy
's
sea
lift
forces
were
given
to
a
new
Air
Force
bureaucracy
in
Illinois
,
its
space
operations
to
another
command
in
Colorado
,
the
frogmen
to
a
new
Army
bureaucracy
in
Fort
Bragg
,
and
the
Navy
's
Indian
Ocean
and
Persian
Gulf
forces
to
an
Army
bureaucracy
in
Florida
.

Which
brings
up
the
worst
and
meanest
ghost
of
all
--
the
ghost
of
the
shah
of
Iran
.

When
the
shah
died
,
President
Carter
was
so
scared
that
the
shah
's
ghost
would
blame
him
for
shoving
him
out
to
make
way
for
the
ayatollah
that
he
declared
the
Carter
Doctrine
.

Mr.
Carter
said
he
would
go
to
war
to
stop
anyone
from
trying
to
grab
Iran
.

But
that
ghost
would
n't
settle
for
words
,
he
wanted
money
and
people
--
lots
.

So
Mr.
Carter
formed
three
new
Army
divisions
and
gave
them
to
a
new
bureaucracy
in
Tampa
called
the
Rapid
Deployment
Force
.

But
that
ghost
was
n't
fooled
;
he
knew
the
RDF
was
neither
rapid
nor
deployable
nor
a
force
--
even
though
it
cost
$
8
billion
or
$
10
billion
a
year
.

After
Mr.
Carter
was
defeated
in
1980
,
the
shah
's
ghost
claimed
the
credit
and
then
went
after
President
Reagan
and
Cap
Weinberger
.

I
saw
what
he
did
to
them
firsthand
.

It
made
my
shoelaces
dance
with
terror
.

Why
,
he
used
to
lay
in
wait
for
Cap
;
suddenly
he
'd
leap
from
behind
some
statue
of
Marshall
onto
Cap
's
chest
and
grab
him
by
the
throat
and
choke
him
till
he
coughed
up
an
additional
$
2
billion
or
so
.

Cap
added
four
more
divisions
to
the
Army
,
two
active
and
two
reserve
;
two
carrier
groups
to
the
Navy
;
a
division
--
equivalent
to
the
Marines
;
and
the
C-5B
,
KC-10
,
C-17
and
a
thousand
tactical
aircraft
to
the
Air
Force
.

He
bought
$
4
billion
in
prepositioning
ships
and
$
7
billion
in
ammo
and
equipment
to
fill
them
,
and
parked
them
at
a
new
$
6
billion
base
at
Diego
Garcia
in
the
middle
of
the
Indian
Ocean
.

He
dedicated
all
these
new
forces
to
the
Persian
Gulf
.

One
night
both
Marshall
's
ghost
and
the
shah
's
ghost
together
caught
Cap
and
threw
him
to
the
ground
.

Before
they
let
him
go
he
added
a
thousand
bureaucrats
to
the
RDF
in
Tampa
and
renamed
it
Central
Command
.

He
gave
those
bureaucrats
charge
of
all
naval
operations
in
the
Persian
Gulf
and
Indian
Ocean
.

Marshall
figured
it
would
be
good
training
for
those
soldiers
--
someday
maybe
they
would
get
the
whole
Navy
.

They
had
fun
moving
the
carriers
around
,
but
it
turned
out
that
they
had
forgotten
all
about
mine
sweepers
.

But
the
shah
still
kept
leaping
out
at
Cap
,
so
Cap
bought
a
hundred
merchant
ships
more
and
$
7
billion
of
loading
barges
,
ramps
,
etc.
,
in
order
that
those
seven
new
Army
divisions
and
three
Marine
brigades
could
unload
from
all
those
new
ships
and
aircraft
and
go
to
war
in
the
Zagros
mountains
.

Then
suddenly
Ike
's
ghost
came
to
visit
and
said
,
``
What
the
hell
are
you
doing
planning
for
a
land
war
in
Asia
12,000
miles
away
?

We
'd
get
our
asses
kicked
.
''

Lucky
for
Cap
,
Ike
was
easygoing
and
soon
went
away
,
while
the
shah
--
he
kept
coming
back
.

So
the
U.S.
found
itself
paying
about
$
2
billion
in
baksheesh
to
various
Arab
potentates
for
basing
rights
around
the
Indian
Ocean
.

We
had
great
success
in
Somalia
.

But
then
it
turned
out
that
President
Siad
Barrah
was
not
at
all
a
nice
person
and
the
Navy
pointed
out
that
the
base
he
promised
us
in
Berbera
had
silted
up
about
a
hundred
years
ago
and
anyway
was
1,244
miles
from
the
mouth
of
the
Gulf
.

(
But
who
's
counting
.
)

Still
,
Berbera
was
the
best
we
could
get
,
so
we
stay
in
bed
with
President
Barrah
.

All
these
reports
about
him
committing
genocide
are
probably
exaggerated
anyway
.

But
would
n't
you
know
,
now
that
we
are
spending
jillions
of
dollars
,
and
have
built
those
new
divisions
and
new
air
wings
,
and
have
positioned
all
these
ships
and
supplies
to
fight
the
Russians
in
Iran
,
the
Russians
seem
to
have
lost
interest
in
the
whole
subject
.

Meanwhile
,
Congress
is
cutting
huge
chunks
out
of
the
rest
of
the
defense
budget
.

Predictably
,
some
Navy
guys
said
:
``
Do
we
still
need
to
keep
all
18
Army
divisions
on
active
duty
and
all
those
extra
land-based
aircraft
without
bases
and
all
those
Army
guys
playing
admiral
in
Tampa
?

Could
n't
we
save
$
20
billion
or
$
30
billion
a
year
by
shifting
that
stuff
to
the
reserves
?

And
why
not
save
the
costs
of
a
thousand
bureaucrats
by
abolishing
Central
Command
and
putting
responsibility
for
Gulf
naval
operations
back
where
it
belongs
,
afloat
with
the
task
force
commander
in
the
Gulf
?

And
where
were
all
our
handsomely
paid
Indian
Ocean
allies
last
year
when
our
convoys
were
being
attacked
?
''

Questions
like
that
really
stir
up
Marshall
's
ghost
.

He
appeared
late
one
night
in
the
bedroom
of
the
new
defense
secretary
,
Dick
Cheney
.

Marshall
came
clanking
in
like
Marley
's
ghost
dragging
those
chains
of
brigades
and
air
wings
and
links
with
Arab
despots
.

He
would
n't
leave
until
Mr.
Cheney
promised
to
do
whatever
the
Pentagon
systems
analysts
told
him
.

So
next
day
Mr.
Cheney
went
out
and
did
just
that
:
He
canceled
the
600-ship
Navy
and
cut
back
one
carrier
and
20
frigates
.

Then
he
canceled
production
of
the
Navy
's
most
important
carrier
aircraft
,
the
F-14
and
the
A-6
.

On
the
other
hand
,
Mr.
Cheney
retained
all
those
new
land
forces
.

Marshall
's
ghost
is
satisfied
for
now
,
but
he
'll
be
back
.

What
with
Halloween
coming
and
bigger
defense
cuts
looming
,
more
and
more
Pentagon
bureaucrats
are
crawling
under
their
desks
.

They
know
that
they
can
hold
off
the
ghosts
only
a
little
while
longer
by
cutting
carriers
and
ships
.

Then
the
whole
thing
will
start
to
collapse
,
just
as
it
did
in
the
1970s
,
and
the
ghosts
and
banshees
will
be
howling
through
the
place
turning
people
's
hair
white
.

Gives
me
the
willies
just
thinking
about
it
.

Mr.
Lehman
,
a
Reagan
Navy
secretary
,
is
a
managing
director
of
PaineWebber
.

The
metal
and
marble
lobby
of
CenTrust
Bank
's
headquarters
is
grander
than
your
average
savings
and
loan
.

For
one
thing
,
there
is
an
old
master
on
the
wall
--
``
Samuel
Anointing
David
,
''
a
big
baroque
canvas
painted
by
Mattia
Preti
,
a
17th-century
Neapolitan
.

At
the
moment
,
however
,
the
painting
is
a
nagging
reminder
of
the
problems
that
have
engulfed
CenTrust
and
its
flamboyant
chairman
and
chief
executive
,
David
L.
Paul
.

In
an
international
buying
spree
that
began
barely
two
years
ago
,
Mr.
Paul
amassed
a
collection
of
about
30
pre-18th-century
works
,
including
the
Preti
,
at
a
total
cost
of
$
28
million
.

By
midnight
Oct.
6
,
all
of
the
paintings
were
supposed
to
have
been
sold
off
,
under
orders
from
Florida
's
comptroller
,
whose
office
regulates
the
state
's
S&Ls
.

CenTrust
did
n't
meet
the
deadline
.

The
collection
was
at
the
heart
of
a
grandiose
plan
Mr.
Paul
had
in
which
the
art
was
to
do
double
duty
--
as
an
investment
for
CenTrust
and
as
decoration
for
the
S&L
's
new
office
tower
,
designed
by
I.M.
Pei
.

The
rub
is
that
the
$
28
million
was
plucked
from
the
funds
of
this
federally
insured
institution
even
as
CenTrust
was
losing
money
hand
over
fist
.

Mr.
Paul
had
no
right
to
buy
art
for
the
S&L
in
the
first
place
--
it
is
n't
on
the
comptroller
's
``
permissible
''
list
--
without
seeking
a
special
dispensation
,
which
he
did
not
do
.

Besides
that
,
some
of
the
paintings
that
were
to
grace
the
walls
of
CenTrust
actually
ended
up
hanging
in
the
chairman
's
estate
on
La
Gorce
Isle
off
Miami
Beach
.

Last
spring
,
the
comptroller
's
office
called
a
halt
to
Mr.
Paul
's
fling
,
giving
him
six
months
to
sell
the
paintings
.

The
acquisitions
,
officials
said
in
a
letter
to
Mr.
Paul
,
were
``
unsafe
,
unsound
and
unauthorized
.
''

So
far
,
Mr.
Paul
has
unloaded
but
three
of
his
masterpieces
,
he
wo
n't
say
to
whom
.

The
comptroller
's
office
says
it
is
``
monitoring
the
situation
.
''

Though
the
agency
could
remove
Mr.
Paul
,
it
has
no
current
intention
to
do
that
.

``
It
's
not
like
selling
Chevrolets
,
''
Mr.
Paul
says
,
as
he
takes
a
drag
on
a
goldbanded
St.
Moritz
cigarette
.

``
The
last
six
months
has
established
the
quality
of
the
collection
.

There
's
no
fire
sale
here
.
''

Despite
Mr.
Paul
's
characteristic
hauteur
,
the
50-year-old
,
chain-smoking
dynamo
is
finding
that
getting
CenTrust
--
Florida
's
largest
thrift
institution
--
out
of
its
riskiest
investments
is
much
tougher
than
getting
into
them
had
been
.

Paintings
are
just
part
of
the
picture
.

Although
Mr.
Paul
has
pared
a
$
1.35
billion
junk-bond
portfolio
to
less
than
$
900
million
since
April
,
the
high-yield
debt
market
has
plummeted
.

Divesting
itself
of
what
is
left
,
as
is
required
of
all
thrift
institutions
by
July
1994
under
the
new
federal
S&L
bailout
law
,
may
well
prove
difficult
.

And
CenTrust
has
other
problems
.

Late
last
week
federal
regulators
ordered
the
thrift
institution
to
stop
paying
dividends
on
its
preferred
stock
--
a
move
that
suggests
deep
concern
about
an
institution
.

Mr.
Paul
has
a
plan
to
bring
in
$
150
million
by
selling
off
63
of
CenTrust
's
71
branches
,
but
it
has
yet
to
be
approved
by
regulators
.

It
is
Mr.
Paul
's
art
venture
,
however
,
that
has
drawn
the
most
attention
from
investors
and
regulators
,
not
to
mention
galleries
throughout
the
world
.

Embittered
shareholders
(
some
of
whom
are
suing
)
say
the
chairman
and
his
collection
epitomize
the
excesses
of
speculation
that
set
off
the
national
S&L
crisis
.

(
CenTrust
shares
have
fallen
sharply
in
price
from
a
high
of
$
15.125
in
1986
to
close
yesterday
at
$
2.875
.
)

Gallery
directors
,
meanwhile
,
say
Mr.
Paul
and
others
of
his
ilk
have
left
an
indelible
mark
on
the
art
world
--
and
not
for
the
better
.

Collectors
do
n't
say
``
It
's
a
van
Gogh
''
anymore
,
laments
Harry
Brooks
,
the
president
of
Wildenstein
&
Co.
,
a
New
York
gallery
.

``
They
say
,
`
Johnny
Payson
got
$
53
million
for
his
,
so
certainly
$
10
million
is
n't
too
much
for
mine
.
'

The
great
collectors
we
depended
on
,
such
as
Paul
Mellon
or
Norton
Simon
,
have
stopped
buying
,
and
the
new
buyers
are
brilliant
men
who
made
money
in
the
stock
market
or
in
takeovers
and
rushed
into
collecting
...
.
''

Mr.
Payson
,
an
art
dealer
and
collector
,
sold
Vincent
van
Gogh
's
``
Irises
''
at
a
Sotheby
's
auction
in
November
1987
to
Australian
businessman
Alan
Bond
.

(
Trouble
is
,
Mr.
Bond
has
yet
to
pay
up
,
and
until
he
does
,
Sotheby
's
has
the
painting
under
lock
and
key
.
)

When
Mr.
Paul
moved
in
on
the
art
market
,
he
let
it
be
known
that
virtually
no
piece
was
too
costly
to
be
considered
by
CenTrust
.

He
established
his
reputation
as
a
freespender
in
January
last
year
at
Sotheby
's
auction
of
the
Linda
and
Gerald
Guterman
collection
in
New
York
.

There
,
on
one
of
his
first
shopping
trips
,
Mr.
Paul
picked
up
several
paintings
at
stunning
prices
.

He
paid
$
2.2
million
,
for
instance
,
for
a
still

Jansz.
den
Uyl
that
was
expected
to
fetch
perhaps
$
700,000
.

The
price
paid
was
a
record
for
the
artist
.

(
Some
64
%
of
items
offered
at
the
Guterman
auction
were
sold
,
at
an
average
price
of
$
343,333
.

The
rest
were
withdrawn
for
lack
of
acceptable
bids
.
)

Afterward
,
Mr.
Paul
is
said
by
Mr.
Guterman
to
have
phoned
Mr.
Guterman
,
the
New
York
developer
selling
the
collection
,
and
gloated
.

``
He
says
he
`
stole
them
,
'
''
recalls
Mr.
Guterman
.

``
And
he
tells
me
,
`
If
you
want
to
see
your
paintings
,
you
'll
have
to
come
to
my
house
in
Florida
.
'
''

Mr.
Paul
denies
phoning
and
gloating
.

``
It
's
just
not
true
,
''
he
says
.

Mr.
Paul
quickly
became
more
aggressive
in
his
collecting
,
with
the
help
of
George
Wachter
,
a
Sotheby
's
expert
in
old
masters
whom
he
met
at
an
exhibition
of
the
Guterman
items
.

Mr.
Wachter
,
who
became
his
principal
adviser
,
searched
galleries
in
London
,
Paris
and
Monaco
.

And
,
according
to
one
dealer
,
Mr.
Wachter
had
a
penchant
for
introducing
Mr.
Paul
with
the
phrase
:
``
He
can
buy
anything
.
''

Nicholas
Hall
,
the
president
of
the
Colnaghi
U.S.A.
Ltd.
gallery
in
New
York
,
sold
Mr.
Paul
``
Abraham
and
Sarah
in
the
Wilderness
''
by
Giovanni
Battista
Tiepolo
.

Mr.
Hall
says
Mr.
Paul
``
was
known
to
spend
a
lot
of
money
.

People
were
interested
in
seeing
him
,
but
it
was
recognized
that
the
route
was
through
Sotheby
's
and
particularly
George
Wachter
.
''

Mr.
Paul
thus
developed
a
close
,
symbiotic
relationship
with
Sotheby
's
.

Mr.
Paul
was
eager
to
assemble
a
collection
for
the
headquarters
CenTrust
has
been
moving
into
for
the
greater
part
of
a
year
.

Sotheby
's
,
the
auction
house
founded
in
London
1744
and
now
under
the
umbrella
of
Sotheby
's
Holdings
Inc.
,
was
hoping
to
stir
up
interest
in
old
masters
as
it
strove
to
build
its
U.S.
business
.

European
dealers
continued
to
dominate
the
action
in
old
masters
,
which
Sotheby
's
North
America
had
lately
been
touting
in
this
country
.

For
several
months
,
there
was
optimism
all
around
.

Last
October
,
Mr.
Paul
paid
out
$
12
million
of
CenTrust
's
cash
--
plus
a
$
1.2
million
commission
--
for
``
Portrait
of
a
Man
as
Mars
.
''

The
painting
,
attributed
to
Flemish
artist
Peter
Paul
Rubens
,
was
purchased
privately
through
Sotheby
's
,
not
at
auction
.

In
March
1989
,
just
15
months
into
his
campaign
,
Mr.
Paul
was
named
by
Art
&
Antiques
magazine
as
one
of
the
top
100
individual
collectors
in
the
U.S.
.

``
An
unknown
quantity
to
most
of
the
art
world
,
Paul
is
no
stranger
to
lavish
spending
,
''
the
magazine
said
,
noting
that
he
does
n't
stop
at
paint
on
canvas
but
also
spends
big
on
art
you
can
eat
.

``
He
recently
bid
$
30,000
at
a
Paris
charity
auction
for
a
dinner
cooked
by
six
of
the
world
's
great
chefs
,
but
the
final
party
cost
closer
to
$
100,000
.
''

(
Mr.
Paul
says
it
was
n't
that
high
.
)

The
art
collection
might
have
come
to
rival
the
Medicis
'
had
the
Florida
comptroller
's
office
not
got
wind
of
Mr.
Paul
's
aesthetic
adventure
.

In
its
letter
to
him
,
dated
March
2
and
shared
with
reporters
,
Alex
Hager
,
the
chief
of
the
thrift-institution
bureau
in
the
comptroller
's
office
,
expressed
puzzlement
that
the
S&L
could
be
so
profligate
when
it
had
reported
losses
of
more
than
$
13
million
in
its
two
preceding
quarters
.

The
state
gave
CenTrust
30
days
to
sell
the
Rubens
.

The
comptroller
's
office
eventually
extended
the
deadline
to
six
months
but
broadened
its
demands
,
ordering
that
the
``
book
value
of
the
collection
{
be
}
reduced
to
zero
.
''

In
other
words
:
Get
rid
of
all
the
pictures
.

The
state
obliquely
noted
that
unsafe
banking
practices
are
grounds
for
removing
an
officer
or
director
and
closed
with
the
admonition
to
Mr.
Paul
:
``
Govern
yourself
accordingly
.
''

The
state
agency
was
particularly
vexed
to
learn
that
the
Rubens
and
a
half-dozen
other
paintings
listed
among
the
bank
's
``
furniture
and
fixtures
,
''
were
actually
hanging
in
the
chairman
's
house
.

Mr.
Paul
says
that
at
one
point
he
did
indeed
have
eight
or
nine
of
the
paintings
at
home
and
that
the
rest
were
in
storage
at
Sotheby
's
.

He
explains
that
he
was
``
merely
storing
the
paintings
at
home
--
with
some
display
--
because
of
the
special
dehumidified
environment
''
required
for
their
safekeeping
,
until
CenTrust
's
new
building
was
ready
for
them
.

Still
,
the
incident
was
embarrassing
.

It
came
on
the
heels
of
a
number
of
local
newspaper
articles
suggesting
that
Mr.
Paul
has
benefited
handsomely
from
his
association
with
CenTrust
.

For
instance
,
he
got
a
$
3
million
loan
from
the
S&L
,
negotiated
at
a
below-market
rate
.

He
owns
43
%
of
CenTrust
's
shares
.

Adding
to
Mr.
Paul
's
problems
,
dealers
(
some
with
vested
interests
)
insist
that
he
,
relying
rather
too
heavily
on
Sotheby
's
advice
,
paid
much
too
much
for
several
pieces
in
the
CenTrust
collection
.

The
$
12
million
lavished
on
the
Rubens
,
for
example
,
was
a
record
price
for
the
artist
and
maybe
twice
its
value
,
given
a
dispute
among
scholars
about
its
provenance
.

David
Tunick
,
the
president
of
David
Tunick
Inc.
,
a
New
York
gallery
,
says
scholars
question
the
authenticity
of
the
Rubens
.

It
may
have
been
painted
instead
by
a
Rubens
associate
.

``
The
feeling
among
many
experts
on
the
commercial
side
is
that
the
price
paid
at
the
time
was
excessive
in
any
event
,
''
Mr.
Tunick
says
.

``
It
sounds
like
with
the
Rubens
he
got
absolutely
taken
to
the
cleaners
.
''

Victor
Wiener
,
the
executive
director
of
the
Appraisers
Association
of
America
,
agrees
that
Mr.
Paul
paid
very
dearly
for
the
Rubens
and
adds
that
getting
rid
of
it
any
time
soon
for
a
similar
sum
would
be
quite
a
feat
.

``
It
's
not
beyond
credibility
the
Rubens
will
someday
be
worth
$
12
million
,
but
whether
it
could
be
sold
for
that
amount
tomorrow
remains
to
be
seen
.
''

Still
,
predicting
is
tricky
.

``
I
'm
forever
dumbfounded
by
what
I
see
making
these
high
prices
.
''

Jonathan
H.
Kress
,
the
son
of
the
painting
's
former
owner
,
Mrs.
Rush
Kress
,
dismisses
the
price
talk
as
``
sour
grapes
.
''

Dealers
contemptuous
of
the
purchase
price
,
he
says
,
were
themselves
interested
in
buying
the
Rubens
but
lost
out
.

Mr.
Paul
,
for
his
part
,
defends
the
Rubens
price
,
saying
a
lot
of
the
experts
have
never
seen
the
thing
itself
.

``
Most
of
them
were
n't
even
born
the
last
time
the
painting
was
displayed
publicly
,
''
he
says
.

Art
prices
are
skyrocketing
,
but
a
good
deal
of
legerdemain
is
involved
in
compiling
statistics
on
sales
.

Salomon
Brothers
Inc.
,
the
investment-banking
firm
,
in
its
annual
tally
of
investment
returns
,
reported
that
old
masters
appreciated
51
%
in
the
year
ended
June
1
,
the
greatest
return
of
any
of
13
assets
it
tracked
.

(
Impressionist
and
modern
paintings
,
not
tracked
by
Salomon
,
are
ranked
even
higher
at
74
%
by
Sotheby
's
.
)

Salomon
,
moreover
,
gets
its
data
on
art
appreciation
from
Sotheby
's
,
whose
prices
go
up
with
clients
like
Mr.
Paul
in
its
thrall
.

The
percentages
omit
from
consideration
the
many
paintings
that
go
begging
at
auction
.

Art
indexes
track
winners
,
not
losers
.

But
art
that
has
fallen
sharply
in
value
is
rarely
put
up
for
sale
.

Also
,
at
any
of
Sotheby
's
auctions
of
old
masters
,
roughly
one-third
to
one-fifth
of
what
is
offered
does
n't
sell
at
any
price
.

It
's
not
that
there
are
n't
any
bids
,
but
the
bids
do
n't
meet
the
minimum
``
reserve
''
prices
set
by
the
sellers
.

In
January
,
the
Preti
painting
that
now
hangs
at
CenTrust
was
expected
to
bring
no
more
than
$
700,000
at
auction
until
Mr.
Paul
came
along
with
his
$
1.15
million
.

Mr.
Hall
of
the
Colnaghi
gallery
says
$
1.15
million
``
would
have
been
an
impossible
price
for
anyone
to
ask
for
a
Preti
four
years
ago
.
''

But
from
his
vantage
point
,
it
is
n't
that
Mr.
Paul
,
a
customer
of
his
too
,
overpaid
for
the
work
,
``
a
gargantuan
painting
by
an
artist
who
is
not
a
household
word
.
''

(
The
painting
is
10
feet
wide
,
seven
feet
high
.
)

Rather
,
``
It
just
shows
things
have
changed
.
''

Mr.
Paul
boasts
that
he
spotted
bargains
in
old
masters
just
before
they
took
an
upward
turn
.

``
They
went
up
51
%
last
year
,
and
they
'll
do
it
again
this
year
,
''
he
declares
.

``
They
were
a
sleeper
.

Everybody
was
out
buying
Monets
.
''

Sotheby
's
vice
president
Diana
Levitt
says
the
auction
house
has
been
``
assisting
''
Mr.
Paul
in
selling
the
paintings
.

And
while
Sotheby
's
chief
rivals
in
the
art
world
,
private
art
dealers
,
``
wo
n't
be
happy
to
hear
it
,
''
she
adds
,
``
a
number
of
{
the
artworks
}
have
already
been
sold
,
and
at
a
substantial
profit
.
''

Mr.
Paul
claims
to
have
sold
three
paintings
,
at
more
than
a
10
%
profit
.

That
is
n't
51
%
,
and
the
claim
is
n't
documented
.

He
furthermore
denies
that
he
relied
too
heavily
on
Sotheby
's
or
Mr.
Wachter
.

Mr.
Paul
says
he
had
not
one
but
four
advisers
and
that
he
never
bid
impulsively
.

After
all
,
he
had
the
counsel
of
``
curators
from
the
most
reputable
museums
in
the
world
.
''

He
says
he
expects
to
sell
the
collection
--
including
the
controversial
Rubens
--
``
carefully
and
prudently
,
just
as
it
was
put
together
.
''

But
in
art-world
parlance
,
Mr.
Paul
's
holdings
are
``
burnt
.
''

That
is
,
he
is
being
compelled
to
put
them
on
the
market
too
soon
,
and
has
already
gotten
offers
that
are
less
than
he
paid
for
some
of
the
art
works
.

``
After
a
few
years
,
you
can
argue
there
has
been
natural
appreciation
,
''
says
Susan
Theran
,
the
publisher
of
Leonard
's
Annual
Price
Index
of
Art
Auctions
.

But
quick
turnover
in
artwork
is
``
like
pawning
your
jewelry
--
you
end
up
with
50
%
.

People
hold
out
and
try
to
get
a
bargain
.
''

Sotheby
's
defends
itself
and
Mr.
Paul
in
the
matter
.

Mr.
Wachter
says
Mr.
Paul
was
a
quick
study
who
worked
intensely
and
bought
the
best
pictures
available
at
the
moment
.

``
On
occasion
,
he
paid
a
high
price
,
''
Mr.
Wachter
concedes
,
but
he
says
those
who
bid
less
and
dropped
out
were
dealers
who
would
then
have
marked
up
the
paintings
to
resell
them
at
a
profit
to
collectors
.

Naomi
Bernhard
Levinson
,
a
fine-arts
appraiser
at
Bernhard
Associates
in
San
Francisco
,
considers
it
``
definite
conflict
of
interest
for
an
auction
house
to
both
advise
a
client
on
purchases
and
to
set
price
estimates
on
the
paintings
to
be
purchased
.
''

Sotheby
's
,
she
says
,
is
``
wearing
both
hats
.
''

``
I
ca
n't
see
why
there
would
be
a
conflict
of
interest
,
''
says
Sotheby
's
Ms.
Levitt
.

``
Estimates
are
based
on
the
previous
price
of
similar
works
sold
at
auction
and
current
market
conditions
,
and
are
not
affected
by
any
knowledge
of
who
the
potential
buyer
could
be
.
''

Frequently
,
clients
express
interest
in
paintings
but
do
n't
end
up
bidding
,
she
adds
,
``
so
we
do
n't
know
who
the
potential
buyer
will
be
.
''

Mr.
Paul
,
in
selling
off
his
paintings
,
is
seeking
at
least
a
15
%
return
on
the
bank
's
investment
,
so
as
to
prove
that
the
venture
was
sound
.

Mr.
Paul
says
that
he
has
feelers
out
over
much
of
the
globe
and
that
potential
buyers
from
as
far
away
as
Japan
and
Italy
have
examined
the
collection
.

Because
of
the
pressure
on
CenTrust
to
sell
,
dealers
and
collectors
have
been
trying
to
get
the
paintings
at
bargain-basement
prices
.

But
so
far
,
Mr.
Paul
and
his
advisers
are
holding
fast
.

One
dealer
,
Martin
Zimet
of
French
&
Co.
in
New
York
,
says
he
``
would
have
loved
to
buy
''
a
Jan
Davids
de
Heem
painting
from
the
bank
.

``
I
tried
to
steal
the
picture
--
to
buy
it
attractively
--
and
{
Sotheby
's
}
would
n't
do
it
.

They
were
protecting
his
interests
.
''

Meanwhile
,
Mr.
Paul
and
CenTrust
executives
are
getting
squeamish
about
opulence
.

Mr.
Paul
has
been
characterized
as
``
the
Great
Gatsby
or
something
,
''
complains
Karen
E.
Brinkman
,
an
executive
vice
president
of
CenTrust
.

The
media
,
she
says
,
have
distorted
his
personal
life
.

Mr.
Paul
nods
in
agreement
.

``
I
do
n't
think
I
have
a
life
style
that
is
,
frankly
,
so
flamboyant
,
''
he
says
.

But
at
just
that
moment
,
he
is
interrupted
in
his
office
by
a
servant
in
tuxedo
who
pours
coffee
from
silver
into
a
cup
of
china
and
dabs
the
brim
with
linen
.

Mr.
Paul
says
,
yes
,
the
ceiling
in
his
executive
suite
is
gold-leaf
inlay
.

The
offices
are
done
in
hardwood
and
oriental
rugs
,
leatherbound
books
and
,
of
course
,
a
$
12
million
Rubens
.

But
he
implores
that
the
splendor
be
played
down
.

``
Do
n't
say
it
's
a
gold
ceiling
.

Just
say
the
offices
are
tastefully
appointed
,
''
he
says
.

``
Otherwise
,
the
regulators
will
take
it
for
decadence
,
and
nowadays
everything
's
got
to
be
pristine
.
''

centennial
year
,
The
Wall
Street
Journal
will
report
events
of
the
past
century
that
stand
as
milestones
of
American
business
history
.
}

CREATIVE
ACCOUNTING
,
mostly
by
conglomerates
,
forced
CPAs
to
change
their
way
of
setting
standards
to
be
followed
by
corporations
reporting
financial
results
,
standards
that
had
become
all
too
flexible
.

The
new
Financial
Accounting
Standards
Board
(
FASB
)
was
created
in
1972
to
replace
the
Accounting
Principles
Board
of
the
American
Institute
of
Certified
Public
Accountants
.

All
of
the
former
board
's
members
were
CPAs
,
provoking
conflict-of-interest
criticism
because
they
were
writing
rules
while
handling
clients
'
books
at
the
same
time
.

The
new
board
's
seven-member
structure
kept
four
CPAs
,
but
the
others
were
from
industry
and
academia
.

Francis
M.
Wheat
,
a
former
Securities
and
Exchange
Commission
member
,
headed
the
panel
that
had
studied
the
issues
for
a
year
and
proposed
the
FASB
on
March
30
,
1972
.

The
former
board
had
produced
``
21
opinions
and
1,000
critics
''
in
its
12-year
life
,
its
chairman
had
conceded
.

The
climate
was
right
for
the
new
FASB
.

In
the
late
1960s
some
CPAs
failed
to
correct
such
abuses
as
clients
picking
permissive
rules
that
hyped
earnings
and
stock
prices
.

And
in
November
1970
Congress
had
passed
a
special
act
to
overrule
one
board
rule
.

Also
,
James
Needham
,
an
SEC
commissioner
,
in
April
1972
had
warned
that
the
industry
might
face
a
``
federal
agency
writing
accounting
rules
''
if
they
rejected
the
FASB
idea
.

Keepers
of
the
books
,
dubbed
``
figure
filberts
,
''
loathed
the
threat
.

The
FASB
had
its
initial
meeting
on
March
28
,
1973
.

On
Dec.
13
,
1973
,
it
issued
its
first
rule
;
it
required
companies
to
disclose
foreign
currency
translations
in
U.S.
dollars
.

The
FASB
since
then
has
issued
102
rules
,
and
some
still
rile
industry
.

Since
late
1987
,
for
example
,
it
has
put
off
a
rule
dealing
with
deferred
income
taxes
because
of
the
continuing
controversy
over
the
issue
.

Amcast
Industrial
Corp.
said
it
plans
to
repurchase
500,000
shares
,
or
about
7
%
of
its
shares
outstanding
,
in
open
market
transactions
.

The
metal
products
concern
currently
has
7.2
million
common
shares
outstanding
.

Amcast
previously
had
said
it
planned
to
repurchase
shares
,
but
did
n't
disclose
when
or
how
many
shares
it
intended
to
buy
back
.

CAE
Industries
Ltd.
said
its
Link
Flight
Simulation
division
was
awarded
a
contract
by
the
U.S.
Army
for
two
helicopter
simulators
,
which
the
company
valued
at
as
much
as
37
million
Canadian
dollars
(
US$
31.5
million
)
.

CAE
said
the
fixed
price
for
the
first
of
the
AH-64
Apache
combat
mission
simulators
is
C$
19
million
.

It
is
scheduled
for
delivery
in
late
1991
.

The
price
of
the
second
simulator
ranges
between
C$
16.4
million
and
C$
18
million
,
CAE
said
,
depending
on
when
the
Army
exercises
its
option
.

CAE
is
a
Toronto-based
maker
of
commercial
and
military
aircraft
simulators
and
training
equipment

Helionetics
Inc.
said
it
agreed
to
team
with
a
unit
of
Minneapolis-based
Honeywell
Inc.
to
provide
power
amplifiers
for
a
new
military
sonar
system
being
proposed
by
Honeywell
.

Total
value
of
the
contract
could
be
$
100
million
,
Helionetics
said
,
and
work
on
the
project
would
be
about
evenly
divided
.

As
previously
reported
,
Helionetics
emerged
from
Chapter
11
bankruptcy-law
protection
in
February
.

This
Los
Angeles
company
and
its
Union
Federal

Bank
subsidiary
said
more
than
99

of
their
7
1\/4
%
convertible
subordinated
debentures
due
2011
were
tendered
for
conversion
into
UnionFed
common
stock
.

The
conversion
increased
total
equity
capital
by
about
$
38.5
million
to
a
total
of
$
156.8
million
.

David
D.
Lung
was
appointed
president
and
chief
operating
officer
of
this
maker
of
building
materials
for
manufactured
homes
and
recreational
vehicles
.

As
president
,
Mr.
Lung
,
42
years
old
,
succeeds
his
father
,
Mervin
D.
Lung
,
66
,
who
founded
the
company
in
1959
.

Mervin
Lung
remains
chairman
and
chief
executive
officer
.

David
Lung
has
been
with
Patrick
since
1970

and
has
served

administration
and
purchasing
since
1987

General
Dynamics
Services
Co.
,
a
unit
of
General
Dynamics
Corp.
,
won
a
$
48.2
million
Army
contract
to
establish
maintenance
facilities
for
tracked
vehicles
in
Pakistan
.

Grumman
Corp.
was
given
a
$
15
million
Navy
contract
for
aircraft-electronics
improvements
.

Hughes
Aircraft
Co.
,
a
unit
of
General
Motors
Corp.
,
got
a
$
10.3
million
Air
Force
contract
for
airborne-radar
equipment
.

Reynolds
Metals
Co.
said
third-quarter
net
income
dropped
nearly
10
%
to
$
123.7
million
,
or
$
2.10
a
share
,
from
$
137.2
million
,
or
$
2.56
a
share
,
a
year
earlier
.

The
latest
earnings
reflect
an
increase
of
about
5.5
million
in
common
shares
outstanding
.

Revenue
rose
3
%
to
$
1.52
billion
from
$
1.48
billion
.

Reynolds
is
the
third
big
aluminum
company
since
Friday
to
report
disappointing
earnings
.

The
No.
1
domestic
aluminum
producer
,
Aluminum
Co.
of
America
,
Friday
said
its
earnings
fell
3.2
%
to
$
219
million
,
or
$
2.46
a
share
.

And
Alcan
Aluminium
Ltd.
yesterday
reported
net
income
slid
30
%
to
$
180
million
,
or
77
cents
a
share
,
from
$
258
million
,
or
$
1.07
a
share
.

Analysts
on
average
had
been
expecting
about
$
2.70
for
Alcoa
and
$
1
for
Alcan
.

``
It
's
a
good
indication
that
level
of
profitability
has
peaked
for
the
industry
,
''
says
Vahid
Fathi
,
metals
analyst
with
Prescott
,
Ball
&
Turben
Inc.
,
who
had
estimated
Reynolds
would
earn
about
$
2.35
a
share
.

The
nation
's
No.
2
aluminum
company
said
earnings
were
hurt
by
lower
prices
for
certain
fabricated
aluminum
products
,
which
typically
follow
price
fluctuations
of
primary
ingots
.

The
base
metal
price
has
dropped
30.3
%
from
a
year
earlier
to
78
cents
a
pound
.

Much
of
the
price
decline
has
been
blamed
on
a
slowing
economy
and
the
third
quarter
is
typically
the
industry
's
slowest
period
.

But
William
O.
Bourke
,
chairman
and
chief
executive
officer
,
said
the
ingot
price
``
appears
to
have
bottomed
out
.
''

He
said
shipments
are
continuing
at
a
``
healthy
''
pace
and
the
company
has
no
excess
inventory
.

Aluminum
shipments
of
329,600
metric
tons
were
nearly
equal
to
the
year-earlier
period
,
the
company
said
.

Nevertheless
,
the
company
said
that
in
the
latest
quarter
there
were
increased
material
and
labor
costs
,
including
a
new
employee
profit-sharing
plan
.

In
composite
trading
on
the
New
York
Stock
Exchange
,
Reynolds
closed
at
$
55.375
,
up
$
1.25
.

No
strikeout
,
but
certainly
no
home
run
.

That
's
how
the
stock-picking
game
is
shaping
up
for
the
months
ahead
,
according
to
money
managers
and
a
few
brokers
.

Yesterday
's
88-point
recovery
from
Friday
's
megadrop
in
the
Dow
Jones
industrials
had
many
brokerage
houses
proclaiming
that
stocks
are
a
good
bargain
again
.

But
quite
a
few
money
managers
are
n't
buying
it
.

Weakening
corporate
earnings
,
they
say
,
are
no
prescription
for
a
bull
market
.

``
The
stock
market
ai
n't
going
to
do
much
of
anything
''
for
a
while
,
says
John
Neff
of
Wellington
Management
,
who
runs
the
$
8.3
billion
Windsor
Fund
.

He
suspects
that
Friday
's
market
decline
may
have
a
second
leg
,
perhaps
a
10
%
to
15
%
drop
later
on
.

Mr.
Neff
says
the
stock
market
has
lost
some
powerful
driving
forces
,
namely
earnings
growth
and
the
``
LBO
sweepstakes
''
--
buy-out
fever
that
induced
investors
to
bid
up
whole
groups
of
stocks
,
such
as
media
and
airlines
.

After
sitting
with
20
%
of
his
fund
in
cash
before
Friday
's
sell-off
,
Mr.
Neff
says
he
bought
``
a
narrow
list
of
stocks
''
yesterday
.

With
flat
corporate
profits
on
the
horizon
for
1990
,
money
managers
say
price-earnings
multiples
that
look
cheap
today
might
go
on
being
cheap
for
a
long
time
.

``
This
is
not
a
grossly
overvalued
market
,
but
it
's
not
cheap
either
,
''
says
George
Collins
,
president
of
the
mutual
fund
company
T.
Rowe
Price
Associates
in
Baltimore
.

According
to
Institutional
Brokers
Estimate
System
,
Wall
Street
market
strategists
see
only
a
2.4
%
jump
in
company
profits
in
1990
--
unlike
in
1987
,
when
profits
a
year
out
looked
good
(
they
did
soar
36
%
in
1988
)
.

Bulls
say
the
market
is
an
incredible
bargain
,
priced
at
only
about
12
times
estimated
1989
earnings
for
stocks
in
the
Standard
&
Poor
's
500
index
.

Before
the
1987
crash
,
the
P\/E
was
more
than
20
.

The
common
view
,
says
Abby
Cohen
,
strategist
for
Drexel
Burnham
Lambert
,
is
that
there
will
be
``
mild
economic
growth
,
modest
profit
expansion
,
and
things
are
going
to
be
hunky-dory
.

Our
view
is
that
we
may
see
a
profit
decline
.
''

Some
think
investors
should
sell
into
rallies
.

The
market
``
is
going
to
wind
down
,
''
says
Gerald
W.
Perritt
,
a
Chicago
money
manager
.

``
Things
are
a
little
less
overpriced
''
after
Friday
's
jolt
in
the
market
.

He
expects
stocks
to
decline
an
additional
5
%
to
30
%
,
with
the
Dow
perhaps
bottoming
out
between
2000
and
2100
``
between
now
and
June
.
''

After
Friday
's
decline
,
Mr.
Perritt
's
firm
ran
statistical
tests
on
100
high-quality
stocks
,
using
old-fashioned
value
criteria
devised
by
Benjamin
Graham
,
an
analyst
and
author
in
the
1930s
and
1940s
who
is
widely
considered
to
be
the
father
of
modern
securities
analysis
.

He
found
85
still
overvalued
and
15
fairly
valued
.

Nicholas
Parks
,
a
New
York
money
manager
,
expects
the
market
to
decline
about
15
%
.

``
I
've
been
two-thirds
in
cash
since
July
,
and
I
continue
to
think
that
having
a
defensive
position
is
appropriate
,
''
he
says
.

Companies
that
piled
on
debt
in
leveraged
buy-outs
during
the
past
two
years
``
will
continue
to
surface
as
business
problems
.
''

``
Generalizations
about
value
are
n't
useful
,
''
says
New
York
money
manager
John
LeFrere
of
Delta
Capital
Management
.

For
instance
,
he
says
,
International
Business
Machines
and
Unisys
might
look
cheap
,
but
investors
might
continue
to
do
better
with
stocks
like
Walt
Disney
,
Procter
&
Gamble
and
Coca-Cola
,
strong
performers
in
recent
years
.

Money
manager
Robert
Ross
,
head
of
Duncan
Ross
Associates
Ltd.
in
Vancouver
,
British
Columbia
,
says
stocks
would
have
to
fall
15
%
to
20
%
before
they
are
competitive
with
less
risky
investment
alternatives
.

Fredric
Russell
,
a
money
manager
in
Tulsa
,
Okla.
,
says
Friday
's
cave-in
``
is
going
to
have
more
of
a
permanent
impact
on
the
psyche
of
many
investors
than
Wall
Street
would
want
to
admit
.
''

There
are
still
bulls
out
there
.

``
I
still
think
we
will
have
a
3000
Dow
,
whether
it
's
six
months
or
12
months
from
now
I
do
n't
know
,
''
says
David
Dreman
,
managing
partner
of
Dreman
Value
Management
in
New
York
.

``
We
're
doing
a
little
buying
''
in
some
stocks
``
that
have
really
been
smashed
down
.
''

Many
brokerage
house
officials
also
are
optimistic
.

Yesterday
,
Goldman
Sachs
,
Merrill
Lynch
and
Dean
Witter
all
increased
the
proportion
of
assets
they
recommend
investors
commit
to
stocks
.

Dean
Witter
now
recommends
85
%
,
Goldman
65
%
and
Merrill
Lynch
50
%
.

Some
investors
say
Friday
's
sell-off
was
a
good
thing
,
because
it
deflated
a
lot
of
crazy
takeover
speculation
.

``
It
was
a
healthy
cleansing
,
''
says
Michael
Holland
,
who
runs
Salomon
Brothers
Asset
Management
in
New
York
.

From
here
out
,
these
investors
see
a
return
to
old-fashioned
investing
,
based
on
a
company
's
ability
to
show
profit
growth
.

``
The
fundamentals
are
pretty
strong
,
''
Mr.
Dreman
says
.

``
I
do
n't
see
this
as
a
bear
market
at
all
.

It
's
a
recognition
that
there
was
much
too
much
fluff
in
the
LBO
market
.
''

Friday
's
big
fall
was
``
just
a
blunder
by
the
stock
market
,
''
says
John
Connolly
,
chief
strategist
for
Dean
Witter
.

``
It
was
an
overreaction
to
an
event
{
the
failure
of
a
management
and
union
group
to
get
bank
financing
for
a
takeover
of
UAL
}
that
does
n't
mean
that
much
to
lots
of
stocks
.
''

Many
investors
have
nagging
worries
,
however
.

Newspapers
are
full
of
headlines
about
companies
defaulting
on
their
debts
and
banks
writing
off
real
estate
loans
.

That
hurts
investors
'
confidence
in
the
economy
and
stocks
.

Not
even
all
the
brokerage
firms
see
clear
sailing
ahead
.

``
Disappointing
profits
are
likely
to
get
worse
in
the
next
two
quarters
,
''
says
Mary
Farrell
,
a
market
strategist
at
PaineWebber
.

She
thinks
the
market
could
drop
about
10
%
in
the
next
few
months
,
then
recover
and
go
higher
.

Companies
with
steady
earnings
growth
could
do
well
,
she
says
,
while
others
with
high
debt
or
poor
earnings
could
see
their
shares
decline
far
more
than
10
%
.

The
turmoil
on
Wall
Street
may
benefit
some
retailers
attempting
to
lead
leveraged
buy-outs
of
their
specialty
and
department-store
chains
,
investment
bankers
and
retailers
said
.

Managers
at
five
chains
have
said
in
recent
weeks
that
they
intend
to
bid
for
their
companies
.

The
chains
include
Bloomingdale
's
,
owned
by
Campeau
Corp.
,
Toronto
;
Saks
Fifth
Avenue
and
Marshall
Field
's
,
owned
by
B.A.T
Industries
PLC
,
London
;
and
B.
Altman
&
Co.
and
Sakowitz
Inc.
,
owned
by
Hooker
Corp.
,
which
is
now
being
managed
by
a
court-appointed
provisional
liquidator
.

Hooker
is
based
in
Sydney
,
Australia
.

The
combination
of
so
many
chains
available
for
sale
,
the
recent
failures
of
such
retailing
LBO
's
as
Miller
&
Rhoads
Inc.
and
declining
investor
confidence
will
drive
down
prices
,
retailing
observers
said
.

``
The
pricing
will
become
more
realistic
,
which
should
help
management
,
''
said
Bruce
Rosenthal
,
a
New
York
investment
banker
with
Nathan
S.
Jonas
&
Co
.

``
Investors
are
n't
going
to
be
throwing
money
at
any
of
the
proposed
LBOs
,
but
doing
deals
on
the
basis
of
ridiculous
assumptions
never
made
sense
,
either
.
''

Earlier
this
year
,
bankers
and
other
investors
were
willing
to
provide
financing
because
they
assumed
there
would
be
major
gains
in
both
profitability
and
sales
,
Mr.
Rosenthal
added
.

Those
days
are
over
now
,
he
believes
.

``
Competition
from
third
parties
who
have
cash
and
are
prepared
to
buy
has
always
existed
and
will
continue
,
''
added
Mr.
Rosenthal
.

``
But
when
prices
were
crazy
,
it
was
even
harder
to
do
an
LBO
.

Bankers
believed
in
the
greater-fool
theory
that
says
somebody
else
is
always
willing
to
pay
more
.

This
is
no
longer
true
today
.
''

At
Saks
Fifth
Avenue
,
Paul
Leblang
,
senior
vice
president
,
marketing
,
agreed
that
lower
prices
will
help
his
management
team
in
their
proposed
LBO
.

``
Having
to
take
on
less
debt
would
certainly
be
an
advantage
,
''
said
Mr.
Leblang
.

``
It
would
also
help
us
in
our
search
for
equity
partners
.

To
make
an
LBO
work
,
now
we
are
going
to
need
more
than
just
junk
bonds
.

''
None
believe
the
proposed
management
LBOs
will
be
easy
to
complete
,
especially
at
B.
Altman
&
Co.
,
which
is
under
Chapter
11
bankruptcy
protection
.

Not
only
could
the
Wall
Street
gyrations
damp
Christmas
sales
if
consumers
lose
confidence
in
the
economy
,
but
potential
junk-bond
buyers
are
sure
to
demand
even
stronger
covenants
and
greater
management
equity
participation
.

Further
,
many
institutions
today
holding
troubled
retailers
'
debt
securities
will
be
reticent
to
consider
additional
retailing
investments
.

``
It
's
called
bad
money
driving
out
good
money
,
''
said
one
retailing
observer
.

``
Institutions
that
usually
buy
retail
paper
have
to
be
more
concerned
.
''

However
,
the
lower
prices
these
retail
chains
are
now
expected
to
bring
should
make
it
easier
for
managers
to
raise
the
necessary
capital
and
pay
back
the
resulting
debt
.

In
addition
,
the
fall
selling
season
has
generally
been
a
good
one
,
especially
for
those
retailers
dependent
on
apparel
sales
for
the
majority
of
their
revenues
.

``
What
's
encouraging
about
this
is
that
retail
chains
will
be
sold
on
the
basis
of
their
sales
and
earnings
,
not
liquidation
values
,
''
said
Joseph
E.
Brooks
,
chairman
and
chief
executive
officer
of
Ann
Taylor
Inc.
,
a
specialty
chain
.

``
Retailers
who
had
good
track
records
of
producing
profits
will
have
a
better
chance
to
buy
back
their
companies
.
''

Still
,
most
retailing
observers
expect
that
all
the
proposed
retailing
LBOs
will
depend
partly
on
the
sale
of
junk
bonds
,
a
market
already
in
tumult
,
in
part
because
of
concerns
associated
with
bonds
issued
by
the
Federated
and
Allied
units
of
Campeau
.

``
Prices
for
retail
chains
are
lower
today
than
they
were
last
week
,
which
will
help
management
,
''
said
Gilbert
Harrison
,
chairman
of
Financo
Inc.
,
an
investment-banking
firm
specializing
in
retailing
acquisitions
.

``
But
the
hurdle
of
financing
still
has
to
be
resolved
.

Potential
bondholders
will
either
look
for
greater
equity
participation
on
behalf
of
management
,
or
insist
the
equity
component
of
the
deals
be
substantially
greater
than
in
the
past
.

Sony
Corp.
won
a
pretrial
order
blocking
U.S.
sales
of
Justin
Products
Inc.
's
``
My
Own
''
line
of
portable
audio
players
for
children
.

Judge
John
E.
Sprizzo
issued
the
order
in
Manhattan
federal
court
,
where
Sony
has
accused
the
tiny
company
of
illegally
knocking
off
the
``
My
First
Sony
''
line
.

The
judge
held
that
the
combination
of
colors
used
for
the
Sony
products
is
distinctive
and
subject
to
protection
under
New
York
state
law
,
rather
than
federal
law
.

The
legal
fight
was
the
subject
of
a
Wall
Street
Journal
story
yesterday
.

Justin
's
attorney
,
Charles
E.
Baxley
,
said
Justin
would
ask
an
appeals
court
to
set
aside
the
order
temporarily
,
pending
an
expedited
appeal
.

He
also
repeated
Justin
's
denial
of
Sony
's
charges
.

``
Their
likelihood
of
reversing
us
is
very
slim
,
''
said
Lewis
H.
Eslinger
,
Sony
's
attorney
,
who
said
he
doubts
Justin
will
go
ahead
with
a
trial
.

CONTINENTAL
MORTGAGE
&
EQUITY
TRUST
said
it
will
resume
dividend
payments
with
a
10-cent-a-share
payout
on
Nov.
6
to
shares
of
record
Oct.
25
.

The
Dallas
real
estate
investment
trust
last
paid
a
dividend
on
Dec.
31
,
1987
,
when
shareholders
received
$
1
a
share
.

Despite
continuing
troubles
with
problem
assets
and
nonperforming
loans
,
the
trust
said
it
expects
to
be
able
to
maintain
or
increase
the
rate
of
distributions
because
of
operations
of
joint-venture
properties
.

A
federal
appeals
court
struck
down
a
natural-gas
regulation
that
had
prevented
pipeline
companies
from
passing
to
customers
part
of
$
1
billion
in
costs
from
controversial
``
take-or-pay
''
contracts
.

The
court
,
in
a
3-0
ruling
,
threw
out
a
deadline
set
by
the
Federal
Energy
Regulatory
Commission
for
settling
old
contract
disputes
over
gas
that
the
pipeline
companies
reserved
but
did
n't
use
.

FERC
's
regulation
had
given
pipelines
until
March
31
,
1989
,
to
pass
on
to
customers
as
much
as
50
%
of
the
costs
of
buying
out
their
broken
contracts
,
which
were
made
with
producers
when
gas
prices
were
high
and
supplies
short
.

A
majority
of
old
contracts
were
renegotiated
by
the
deadline
and
settled
at
steep
discounts
.

But
pipeline
companies
estimate
they
still
face
$
2.4
billion
in
liabilities
from
unresolved
disputes
,
including
$
1
billion
they
fear
they
wo
n't
be
able
to
pass
on
to
customers
.

According
to
industry
lawyers
,
the
ruling
gives
pipeline
companies
an
important
second
chance
to
resolve
remaining
disputes
and
take
advantage
of
the
cost-sharing
mechanism
.

The
court
left
open
whether
FERC
could
reimpose
a
new
deadline
later
.

The
court
,
agreeing
with
pipeline
companies
,
found
the
March
31
deadline
was
``
arbitrary
and
capricious
''
and
``
highly
prejudicial
to
the
bargaining
power
of
pipelines
''
that
were
forced
to
negotiate
settlement
of
the
old
take-or-pay
contracts
to
meet
the
deadline
.

A
report
last
month
by
the
Interstate
Natural
Gas
Association
of
America
found
that
pipelines
'
settlement
costs
had
jumped
in
the
three
months
before
the
deadline
to
39
cents
on
the
dollar
,
from
22
cents
on
the
dollar
in
1988
.

The
court
ordered
FERC
to
justify
within
60
days
not
only
its
cost-sharing
deadline
,
but
other
major
elements
of
its
proposed
regulation
for
introducing
more
competition
into
natural-gas
transportation
.

The
court
also
questioned
a
crediting
mechanism
that
could
be
used
to
resolve
take-or-pay
liabilities
.

The
complex
regulation
,
known
in
the
industry
as
Order
500
,
has
been
hotly
contested
by
all
sides
,
including
natural-gas
producers
,
pipelines
,
local
distribution
companies
and
consumers
.

The
court
's
decision
would
allow
FERC
to
change
some
of
its
provisions
,
but
ensures
it
will
be
reviewed
again
quickly
by
the
court
.

MEDUSA
Corp.
said
it
voluntarily
prepaid
$
7
million
on
its
original
$
75
million
term
loan
,
bringing
the
total
debt
reduction
for
the
year
to
$
18
million
.

After
the
payment
,
the
Cleveland
company
owes
$
57
million
on
the
loan
.

The
cement
producer
said
the
payment
was
made
from
excess
cash
flow
.

NATIONAL
INCOME
REALTY
TRUST
said
it
will
resume
dividend
payments
with
a
12-cent-a-share
dividend
to
be
paid
Nov.
6
to
shares
of
record
Oct.
25
.

The
mortgage
and
equity
real
estate
investment
trust
last
paid
a
dividend
on
Aug.
1
,
1988
,
when
holders
received
75
cents
a
share
.

Despite
continuing
troubles
with
problem
properties
and
nonperforming
loans
,
the
Dallas
trust
said
it
has
rebuilt
reserves
,
abandoned
properties
with
little
potential
and
experienced
improved
operating
results
from
joint
ventures
.

MLX
Corp.
said
it
reached
a
preliminary
agreement
with
senior
lenders
to
its
refrigeration
and
air-conditioning
group
to
restructure
the
$
188.5
million
of
credit
facilities
the
lenders
provide
to
the
group
.

MLX
,
which
also
makes
aircraft
and
heavy-duty
truck
parts
,
said
the
debt
was
accumulated
during
its
acquisition
of
nine
businesses
that
make
up
the
group
,
the
biggest
portion
of
which
was
related
to
the
1986
purchase
of
a
Hillman
Co.
unit
.

Among
other
things
,
the
restructured
facilities
will
substantially
reduce
the
group
's
required
amortization
of
the
term
loan
portion
of
the
credit
facilities
through
September
1992
,
MLX
said
.

Certain
details
of
the
restructured
facilities
remain
to
be
negotiated
.

The
agreement
is
subject
to
completion
of
a
definitive
amendment
and
appropriate
approvals
.

William
P.
Panny
,
MLX
chairman
and
chief
executive
,
said
the
pact
``
will
provide
MLX
with
the
additional
time

flexibility
necessary
to
complete
the
restructuring

's
capital
structure

eight
cents

10
cents

A
battle
is
raging
in
Venice
over
plans
to
have
the
1,200-year-old
Italian
city
be
the
site
for
a
universal
exposition
in
2000
.

The
plans
include
a
subway
system
,
a
congress
center
,
floating
trees
,
fanciful
fountains
--
and
as
many
as
60,000
additional
tourists
a
day
.

Expo
enthusiasts
argue
that
holding
the
fair
would
attract
businesses
,
create
jobs
and
help
renovate
abandoned
sections
of
town
.

But
opponents
fear
overcrowding
.

``
This
city
already
has
too
many
tourists
,
and
it
ca
n't
hold
them
all
,
''
says
Pierluigi
Beggiato
,
the
president
of
the
Venice
hoteliers
association

About
40
Italian
businesses
,
including
Fiat

According

the
North
African
nation
is
holding
talks
with

pipeline
,
expanding
capacity
by
up
to
six
billion
cubic

West
German
Environment
Minister
Klaus
Toepfer
said
Bonn
is
convinced
of
the
need
for
cooperation
,
``
especially
with

we
are
directly
affected

The

rushed
an

first
run
sold
out
in

day

Editor
Hasse
Olsson
said
plans
had
called
for
7,000
copies
of

Paev
(

Paper

to
be
sold
at
newsstands
and
an
additional
3,000
promotion
issues
to
be
sent
by
direct
mail
.

He
said
13,000
more
copies
were
sent
to
Estonia
because
of
strong
sales
.

The
Swedish
publishing
company
Bonniers
owns
51
%
of
Are
Paev
,
and
the
Estonian
management
company
Minor
owns
49

Angel
Gurria
,
Mexico
's
top
debt
negotiator
,
said
the
country
's
creditor
banks
are
responding
positively
to
Mexico
's
debt-reduction
package
.

Mr.
Gurria
's
optimism
contrasts
with
some
bankers
'
views
that
the
deal
may
require
a
lot
of
arm
twisting
by
the
U.S.
Treasury
in
order
to
succeed
.

Mr.
Gurria
,
Mexico
's
under-secretary
of
the
ministry
of
finance
,
met
yesterday
with
European
bankers
in
London
,
at
the
half-way
point
on
a
so-called
road
show
to
market
the
package
around
the
world
.

An
increasing
number
of
banks
appear
to
be
considering
the
option
under
the
deal
whereby
they
can
swap
their
Mexican
loans
for
30-year
bonds
with
a
face
value
discounted
by
35
%
,
Mr.
Gurria
said
.

The
other
two
options
consist
of
swapping
loans
for
bonds
with
6.25
%
interest
rates
,
or
providing
fresh
loans
.

The
accord
,
which
covers
$
52.7
billion
of
Mexico

debt
,
is
expected
to
go

effect

THE
R.H.
MACY
&
CO
.
department-store
chain
is
n't
for
sale
.

In
yesterday
's
edition
,
it
was
incorrectly
included
with
a
list
of
New
York
chains
up
for
sale
.

Korean
car
exports
have
slid
about
40
%
so
far
this
year
,
but
auto
makers
here
are
n't
panicking
.

They
are
enjoying
domestic
sales
that
are
more
than
making
up
for
lost
overseas
sales
.

South
Korean
consumers
are
expected
to
buy
almost
500,000
passenger
cars
this
year
,
up
60
%
from
1988
.

In
fact
,
some
auto
executives
suggest
that
slackened
demand
for
their
cars
in
the
U.S.
and
Canada
is
a
blessing
;
otherwise
they
would
n't
be
able
to
keep
up
with
demand
in
the
more
profitable
local
market
.

``
We
are
very
lucky
to
easily
change
an
export
loss
to
domestic
plus
,
''
says
Hong
Tu
Pyo
,
managing
director
of
domestic
marketing
for
Hyundai
Motor
Co
.

As
it
is
,
waiting
lists
of
a
month
are
n't
unusual
for
popular
models
.

Demand
is
so
strong
that
all
of
the
domestic
makers
--
Hyundai
,
Kia
Motors
Corp.
,
Daewoo
Motor
Co.
and
even
upstart
SsangYong
Motor
Co.
--
plan
to
build
more
factories
.

Industry
analysts
predict
that
by
1995
,
South
Korea
will
be
building
three
million
cars
a
year
--
about
half
of
that
for
export
.

It
's
an
optimistic
move
in
a
industry
already
facing
world-wide
overcapacity
.

But
South
Korean
auto
makers
are
confident
that
the
export
market
will
bounce
back
and
that
demand
in
Korea
will
stay
strong
.

Currently
only
one
in
38
South
Koreans
owns
a
car
,
up
from
one
in
200
a
decade
ago
.

``
In
the
year
2000
it
will
be
one
car
per
family
.

At
that
point
domestic
sales
will
slow
down
,
''
says
Kim
Yoon
Kwon
,
director
of
marketing
for
Daewoo
Motor
.

The
reason
for
the
tremendous
demand
is
simple
:
South
Koreans
suddenly
have
a
lot
more
money
.

``
We
never
thought
we
'd
own
a
car
,
''
says
Kwang
Ok
Kyong
,
who
just
bought
a
Daewoo
LeMans
on
a
five-year
loan
.

She
and
her
husband
started
a
small
printing
business
and
need
the
car
for
work
as
well
as
for
weekend
jaunts
.

Pay
raises
of
60
%
over
the
past
three
years
have
given
many
South
Koreans
the
money
to
enjoy
the
things
they
were
supplying
the
rest
of
the
world
.

The
success
of
newcomer
SsangYong
Motor
shows
the
strength
of
the
auto
market
and
its
growing
diversity
.

A
part
of
the
construction-oriented
conglomerate
SsangYong
Group
,
it
took
over
the
dying
Dong-A
Motor
Co.
in
1986
.

SsangYong
began
making
variations
of
the
Jeep-like
``
Korando
''
vehicle
.

(
Dong-A
had
had
a
technology
agreement
with
Jeep
maker
American
Motors
Corp.
,
now
a
part
of
Chrysler
Corp
.
)

The
most
popular
style
is
the
stretched
``
Family
,
''
which
resembles
a
Ford
Bronco
or
Chevy
Blazer
.

The
four-wheel-drive
vehicles
start
at
$
15,000
;
a
Family
can
cost
over
$
25,000
.

SsangYong
,
which
has
only
about
3
%
of
the
domestic
market
,
will
sell
about
18,000
of
its
models
this
year
,
twice
as
many
as
last
year
.

It
sees
sales
rising
45
%
to
26,000
units
next
year
.

The
company
plans
to
expand
plant
capacity
50
%
by
1991
.

By
then
it
also
hopes
to
begin
producing
a
passenger
car
based
on
the
Volvo
240
and
selling
for
about
$
20,000
.

Hyundai
and
Daewoo
seem
unconcerned
about
the
SsangYong
threat
,
but
Kia
,
the
scrappy
No.3
auto
maker
,
is
selling
four-wheel-drive
vehicles
through
its
Asia
unit
.

It
plans
to
sell
1,700
units
in
1989
.

Kia
,
the
only
Korean
car
maker
that
has
seen
its
overseas
sales
grow
in
1989
,
aims
at
Korea
's
common
man
.

Its
advantage
has
been
the
peppy
little
Pride
,
sold
as
the
Ford
Festiva
in
the
U.S.
.

At
3.8
million
won
,
or
$
5,700
,
the
econobox
is
the
lowest-priced
car
in
South
Korea
.

Along
with
two
larger
models
,
the
company
claims
18
%
of
the
domestic
market
.

Ford
Motor
Co.
and
Japan
's
Mazda
Motor
Corp.
have
equity
interests
in
Kia
.

Kia
is
the
most
aggressive
of
the
Korean
Big
Three
in
offering
financing
.

Loans
for
as
long
as
five
years
make
the
cars
very
accessible
,
with
monthly
payments
as
low
as
80,000
won
,
or
$
120
.

Daewoo
Motor
,
a
50-50
joint
venture
with
General
Motors
Corp.
and
the
Daewoo
Group
conglomerate
,
is
the
only
auto
maker
that
appears
to
be
hurting
.

Shipments
of
its
Lemans
to
GM
's
Pontiac
division
are
off
about
65
%
from
a
year
ago
,
versus
a
44
%
decline
for
Hyundai
and
an
18
%
increase
for
Kia
.

Moreover
,
Daewoo
's
domestic
sales
have
grown
half
as
fast
as
sales
of
its
rivals
.

The
big
problem
for
Daewoo
,
which
holds
about
21
%
of
the
market
,
is
the
long
series
of
labor
disruptions
it
suffered
this
year
.

But
Daewoo
is
expanding
too
.

In
fact
,
a
sister
company
,
Daewoo
Shipbuilding
and
Heavy
Machinery
,
plans
to
build
240,000
minicars
by
the
mid-1990s
.

Hyundai
,
the
Korean
market
leader
with
a
58
%
share
,
also
plans
to
jump
into
minicars
at
the
same
time
.

It
has
a
similar
project
for
200,000
cars
a
year
.

Kia
is
reportedly
also
considering
such
a
plan
.

Even
giant
Samsung
Group
is
rumored
in
the
Korean
press
to
be
considering
getting
into
the
auto-making
business
;
a
company
spokesman
had
no
comment
.

Robert
P.
Bulseco
,
44
years
old
,
was
named
president
and
chief
administrative
officer
of
this
regional
commercial
bank
.

Both
posts
had
been
vacant
.

Robert
Robie
,
51
,
was
named
to
the
new
positions
of
vice
chairman
and
chief
credit
officer
.

Many
skittish
mutual
fund
investors
picked
up
the
phone
yesterday
,
but
decided
not
to
cash
in
their
chips
after
all
.

As
the
stock
market
bounced
back
,
withdrawals
of
money
from
stock
funds
amounted
to
a
mere
trickle
compared
with
Black
Monday
,
when
investors
dumped
$
2.3
billion
,
or
about
2
%
of
stock-fund
assets
.

Fidelity
Investments
,
the
nation
's
largest
fund
company
,
said
phone
volume
was
more
than
double
its
typical
level
,
but
still
half
that
of
Oct.
19
,
1987
.

Net
outflows
from
Fidelity
's
stock
funds
stood
at
less
than
$
300
million
,
or
below
15
%
of
the
$
2
billion
cash
position
of
the
firm
's
stock
portfolios
.

Much
of
the
money
was
switched
into
the
firm
's
money
market
funds
.

Outflows
since
the
close
of
trading
Friday
remain
below
one-third
their
level
of
two
years
ago
,
Fidelity
said
.

Other
mutual
fund
companies
reported
even
lighter
withdrawal
requests
.

And
some
investors
at
Fidelity
and
elsewhere
even
began
buying
stock
funds
during
the
day
.

``
Two
years
ago
,
there
was
a
lot
of
redemption
activity
and
trouble
with
people
getting
through
on
the
phone
,
''
said
Kathryn
McGrath
,
head
of
the
investment
management
division
of
the
Securities
and
Exchange
Commission
.

This
time
,
``
We
do
n't
have
that
at
all
.
''

Of
course
,
the
relative
calm
could
be
jolted
if
the
market
plunges
again
.

And
any
strong
surge
in
redemptions
could
force
some
funds
to
dump
stocks
to
raise
cash
,
as
some
did
during
Black
Monday
.

But
funds
generally
are
better
prepared
this
time
around
.

As
a
group
,
their
cash
position
of
10.2
%
of
assets
in
August
--
the
latest
figure
available
--
is
14
%
higher
than
two
years
earlier
.

Many
fund
managers
have
boosted
their
cash
levels
in
recent
weeks
.

The
biggest
flurry
of
investor
activity
came
early
in
the
day
.

Vanguard
Group
Inc.
saw
heavy
exchanges
from
stock
funds
into
money
market
funds
after
the
telephone
lines
opened
at
8:30
a.m
.

``
In
the
first
hour
,
the
real
nervous
folks
came
along
,
''
a
spokesman
said
.

``
But
the
horrendous
pace
of
call
volume
in
the
first
half-hour
slowed
considerably
.
''

At
Scudder
,
Stevens
&
Clark
Inc.
,
phone
calls
came
in
at
40
%
more
than
the
normal
pace
through
early
afternoon
.

Most
of
that
increase
came
in
the
first
hour
after
the
phone
lines
opened
at
8
a.m
.

As
stocks
rose
,
in
fact
,
some
investors
changed
course
and
reversed
their
sell
orders
.

Many
funds
allow
investors
to
void
orders
before
the
close
of
trading
.

At
Scudder
and
at
the
smaller
Ivy
funds
group
in
Hingham
,
Mass.
,
for
instance
,
some
shareholders
called
early
in
the
morning
to
switch
money
from
stock
funds
to
money
market
funds
,
but
later
called
back
to
reverse
the
switches
.

Because
mutual
fund
trades
do
n't
take
effect
until
the
market
close
--
in
this
case
,
at
4
p.m.
--
these
shareholders
effectively
stayed
put
.

At
Fidelity
's
office
in
downtown
Boston
,
Gerald
Sherman
walked
in
shortly
after
7:30
a.m.
and
placed
an
order
to
switch
his
retirement
accounts
out
of
three
stock
funds
and
into
a
money
market
fund
.

But
by
3:15
p.m.
,
with
the
market
comfortably
ahead
for
the
day
,
Mr.
Sherman
was
preparing
to
undo
his
switch
.

``
It
's
a
nice
feeling
to
know
that
things
stabilized
,
''
said
Mr.
Sherman
,
the
51-year-old
co-owner
of
a
discount
department
store
.

But
some
investors
continued
to
switch
out
of
high-risk
,
high-yield
junk
funds
despite
yesterday
's
rebound
from
that
market
's
recent
price
declines
.

Shareholders
have
been
steadily
bailing
out
of
several
big
junk
funds
the
past
several
weeks
as
the
$
200
billion
market
was
jolted
by
a
cash
crunch
at
Campeau
Corp.
and
steadily
declining
prices
.

Much
of
the
money
has
been
switched
into
money
market
funds
,
fund
executives
say
.

Instead
of
selling
bonds
to
meet
redemptions
,
however
,
some
funds
have
borrowed
from
banks
to
meet
withdrawal
requests
.

This
avoids
knocking
down
prices
further
.

The
$
1.1
billion
T.
Rowe
Price
High
Yield
Fund
was
among
the
funds
that
borrowed
during
the
Campeau
crisis
,
says
George
J.
Collins
,
president
of
T.
Rowe
Price
Associates
Inc
.

That
way
,
Mr.
Collins
says
,
``
We
did
n't
have
to
sell
securities
in
a
sloppy
market
.
''

When
the
market
stabilized
,
he
added
,
the
firm
sold
the
bonds
and
quickly
paid
the
loans
back
.

comfortable
and
less
prone
to
falling
out
than
hard
contact
lenses
,
which
had
been
around
since
1939
.

Bausch
&
Lomb
sold
the
softies
under
a
sublicense
from
National
Patent
Development
,
which
had
gained
the
rights
from
the
Czechoslovakia
Academy
of
Sciences
.

Otto
Wichterle
,
a
Czech
,
invented
them
in
1962
.

The
plastic
lens
wraps
itself
over
the
cornea
,
absorbing
eye
moisture
while
permitting
oxygen
to
pass
through
.

But
the
new
lens
became
the
eye
of
a
storm
.

In
September
1971
California
officials
seized
``
bootlegged
''
lenses
--
made
by
unlicensed
companies
--
after
some
showed
traces
of
bacteria
.

In
October
doctors
were
debating
the
product
's
safety
,
some
claiming
it
caused
infections
.

And
there
were
Senate
hearings
on
the
questions
in
July
1972
.

The
product
overcame
the
bad
publicity
and
kept
evolving
.

The
early
soft
lenses
,
which
cost
$
300
a
set
,
were
expected
to
last
for
a
year
.

In
1983
``
extended
wear
''
versions
,
designed
to
be
worn
for
30
days
at
a
time
,
wree
offered
.

Eighteen
months
ago
a
``
disposable
''
seven-day
model
bowed
;
a
year
's
supply
costs
about
$
500
.

Last
month
the
FDA
and
Contact
Lens
Institute
cautioned
users
that
serious
eye
infections
could
result
from
wearing
lenses
more
than
seven
days
at
a
stretch
.

Today
20
million
of
the
25
million
Americans
using
contact
lenses
are
using
the
soft
type
.

Including
the
accesory
eye
care
products
,
contacts
account
for
$
2
billion
in
annual
retail
sales
.

Although
Bausch
remains
the
leader
among
the
six
majors
,
Johnson
&
Johnson
,
with
its
new
disposables
,
is
coming
on
fast
.

The
roller-coaster
stock
market
is
making
life
tougher
for
small
companies
trying
to
raise
money
.

In
the
wake
of
Friday
's
plunge
and
yesterday
's
rebound
,
some
companies
are
already
postponing
deals
,
and
others
wish
they
could
.

As
in
other
jittery
times
,
many
small
businesses
expect
a
particularly
rough
time
raising
funds
as
investors
shun
risky
deals
,
seeking
safety
in
bigger
companies
.

Even
if
stock
prices
fully
recover
from
Friday
's
sharp
decline
,
the
unsettled
conditions
will
frighten
many
investors
.

``
The
implication
of
an
unsettled
situation
is
that
the
thing
could
drop
dramatically
,
''
says
Henry
Linsert
Jr.
,
chairman
of
Martek
Corp.
,
a
four-year-old
biotechnology
company
that
is
planning
a
private
placement
of
stock
.

``
The
more
variables
that
indicate
risk
,
the
more
the
investor
is
going
to
drive
a
hard
bargain
.
''

Earlier
this
month
,
Staples
Inc.
,
a
Newton
,
Mass.
,
office-supplies
discounter
,
said
it
would
accelerate
expansion
plans
nationwide
and
offer
more
of
its
stock
to
the
public
.

At
the
time
,
its
shares
were
selling
above
their
initial
offering
price
of
$
19
,
and
bankers
believed
Staples
would
sell
new
stock
without
a
hitch
.

But
with
the
company
's
shares
standing
at
$
15
yesterday
,
a
new
offering
seems
unlikely
,
company
officials
say
.

Business
,
however
,
continues
to
be
``
robust
,
''
and
the
stock
market
has
n't
affected
the
concern
's
expansion
plans
,
says
Todd
Krasnow
,
a
senior
executive
.

Other
companies
figure
they
ca
n't
avoid
the
market
.

``
We
have
capital
requirements
,
''
says
Mr.
Linsert
,
``
so
we
have
to
go
ahead
''
with
a
planned
$
1.5
billion
private
placement
.

Unless
the
market
goes
right
back
up
,
he
says
,
``
it
may
take
us
six
to
nine
months
to
find
the
money
,
instead
of
three
.
''

And
the
Columbia
,
Md.
,
company
may
have
to
settle
for
a
lower
price
,
he
adds
.

Life
is
particularly
nerve-racking
for
companies
that
had
planned
to
go
public
this
week
.

Hand-holding
is
becoming
an
investment-banking
job
requirement
.

Robertson
,
Stephens
&
Co.
,
a
San
Francisco
investment
banking
concern
,
has
a
client
that
looked
forward
to
making
its
initial
public
offering
yesterday
.

Officers
of
the
company
,
a
health-care
concern
,
``
were
very
discouraged
on
Friday
and
felt
they
should
n't
go
public
;
we
felt
they
should
,
''
says
Sanford
Robertson
,
partner
in
the
banking
concern
.

As
the
market
dropped
Friday
,
Robertson
Stephens
slashed
the
value
of
the
offering
by
7
%
.

Yesterday
,
when
similar
securities
rebounded
,
it
bumped
the
valuation
up
again
.

As
of
late
yesterday
,
the
IPO
was
still
on
.

For
many
,
the
situation
is
especially
discouraging
because
the
market
for
IPOs
was
showing
signs
of
strengthening
after
several
years
of
weakness
.

``
We
were
just
beginning
to
look
at
the
increase
in
IPOs
,
seeing
the
light
at
the
end
of
the
tunnel
,
''
says
Frank
Kline
Jr.
,
partner
in
Lambda
Funds
,
a
Beverly
Hills
,
Calif.
,
venture
capital
concern
.

``
But
the
tunnel
's
just
gotten
longer
.
''

Companies
planning
to
go
public
``
are
definitely
taking
a
second
look
,
''
says
Allen
Hadhazy
,
senior
analyst
at
the
Institute
for
Econometric
Research
,
Fort
Lauderdale
,
Fla.
,
which
publishes
the
New
Issues
newsletter
on
IPOs
.

He
calculates
that
the
recent
market
slide
translated
into
a
5
%
to
7
%
reduction
in
IPO
proceeds
to
companies
.

Many
companies
are
hesitating
.

Exabyte
Corp.
had
been
planning
to
sell
10
%
of
its
stock
this
week
in
an
IPO
that
would
raise
up
to
$
28.5
million
.

But
now
,
Peter
Behrendt
,
president
,
says
,
``
We
're
making
decisions
on
a
day-to-day
basis
.
''

Debt-free
and
profitable
,
the
Boulder
,
Colo.
,
computer-products
concern
could
borrow
funds
if
it
decides
against
an
IPO
now
,
he
says
.

KnowledgeWare
Inc.
,
an
Atlanta
computer-software
concern
,
says
it
is
still
planning
to
go
ahead
with
its
IPO
this
week
or
next
--
unless
conditions
change
.

``
It
's
a
wait-and-see
situation
right
now
,
''
says
Terry
McGowan
,
president
.

Delayed
financings
also
would
affect
the
operations
of
many
companies
.

Sierra
Tucson
Cos.
,
a
Tucson
,
Ariz.
,
operator
of
addiction-treatment
centers
,
has
a
planned
doubling
of
capacity
riding
on
an
IPO
scheduled
for
next
week
.

William
O'Donnell
,
president
,
says
he
still
thinks
the
IPO
will
succeed
.

If
it
does
n't
,
he
says
,
the
company
would
have
to
change
its
expansion
timetable
.

But
the
market
turmoil
could
be
partially
beneficial
for
some
small
businesses
.

In
a
sagging
market
,
the
Federal
Reserve
System
``
might
flood
the
market
with
funds
,
and
that
should
bring
interest
rates
down
,
''
says
Leonard
T.
Anctil
,
vice
president
of
the
Bank
of
New
England
,
Boston
.

James
G.
Zafris
,
president
of
Danvers
Savings
Bank
,
Danvers
,
Mass.
,
says
the
market
turmoil
``
is
an
absolute
non-event
for
small
business
.
''

For
small
companies
,
he
says
,
interest
rates
are
far
more
important
than
what
happens
on
stock
exchanges
.

Mr.
Zafris
thinks
rates
are
heading
down
,
helping
small
companies
.

Peter
Drake
,
biotechnology
analyst
for
Vector
Securities
International
,
Chicago
,
thinks
market
uncertainty
may
encourage
small
companies
to
form
more
strategic
alliances
with
big
corporations
.

Partly
because
the
1987
market
crash
made
it
harder
for
them
to
find
financing
,
many
high-technology
concerns
have
made
such
alliances
recently
.

Some
even
see
a
silver
lining
in
the
dark
clouds
.

Alan
Wells
,
president
of
Bollinger
,
Wells
,
Lett
&
Co.
,
a
New
York
merger
specialist
,
thinks
panicky
investors
may
lose
their
enthusiasm
for
leveraged
buy-out
and
giant
takeover
deals
.

Instead
,
they
could
turn
to
investing
in
smaller
deals
involving
smaller
companies
,
he
says
.

And
William
E.
Wetzel
Jr.
,
a
University
of
New
Hampshire
management
professor
and
director
of
Venture
Capital
Network
Inc.
,
says
the
market
's
gyrations
will
underline
the
investors
'
lack
of
control
in
big
stock
investments
.

This
will
add
to
the
appeal
of
small
business
,
he
says
,
where
investors
often
have
a
degree
of
influence
.

Bay
Financial
Corp.
,
hurt
by
high
debts
and
deteriorating
real
estate
investments
,
reported
a
wider
loss
for
the
fourth
quarter
and
said
it
might
be
forced
to
seek
a
bankruptcy-court
reorganization
if
it
ca
n't
renegotiate
its
borrowings
.

Bay
said
a
``
substantial
part
''
of
its
debt
outstanding
is
in
default
as
a
result
of
inability
to
sell
certain
properties
quickly
and
lower-than-expected
prices
for
sales
made
.

The
company
said
its
real
estate
portfolio
is
``
highly
leveraged
,
''
while
about
two-thirds
of
its
investments
are
n't
income-producing
.

Thus
it
is
coming
up
short
on
a
big
bet
that
quick
sales
at
higher
prices
would
enable
it
to
keep
up
with
mortgage
and
other
debt
payments
.

According
to
its
latest
annual
report
,
about
a
quarter
of
the
company
's
holdings
are
in
Massachusetts
,
in
the
midst
of
a
real-estate
slump
.

The
company
said
it
had
a
net
loss
in
its
fourth
quarter
ended
June
30
of
$
36.2
million
,
or
$
9.33
a
share
,
on
revenue
of
$
13.1
million
.

A
year
earlier
,
the
company
had
a
loss
of
$
10.8
million
,
or
$
3.04
a
share
,
on
revenue
of
$
10.8
million
.

For
the
year
,
it
had
a
net
loss
of
$
62
million
,
or
$
15.97
a
share
,
on
revenue
of
$
44.3
million
.

In
the
previous
year
,
it
had
a
loss
of
$
22.5
million
,
or
$
6.52
a
share
,
on
revenue
of
$
41.1
million
.

Although
it
is
having
serious
cash-flow
problems
,
Bay
said
the
fair-market
value
of
its
holdings
,
minus
debt
,
was
equal
to
$
6.02
a
share
at
June
30
based
on
a
recent
appraisal
.

Book
value
per

,
which

A

TRW
Inc.
reported
a
12
%
decline
in
third-quarter
net
income
,
but
the
company
said
that
excluding
unusual
gains
in
both
quarters
,
operating
profit
rose
16
%
.

The
electronics
,
automotive
and
aerospace
concern
said
third-quarter
net
was
$
60
million
,
or
98
cents
a
share
,
down
from
$
68
million
,
or
$
1.11
a

,
a
year
earlier
.

Share
earnings
are
reported
on
a

basis
,
by
company
tradition
.

Results
for
the
1988
quarter
included
a
gain
of
$
1.05
a
share
from
sale
of
the
Reda
Pump
and
Oilwell
Cable
units
,
partly
offset
by
a
charge
of
69
cents
a
share
for
recall
of
faulty
truck
steering
systems
.

The
latest
quarter
included
a
gain
of
11
cents
a
share
as
a
partial
reversal
of
the
recall
charge
,
because
the
reserve
established
last
year
exceeded
the
actual
recall
costs
.

Sales
for
the
quarter
rose
8.3
%
to
$
1.79
billion
,
from
$
1.65
billion
,
with
all
three
major
product
groups
reporting
gains
.

The
company
said
aerospace
and
defense
sales
were
up
2
%
for
the
quarter
to
$
802
million
,
and
operating
profit
climbed
6
%
to
$
61
million
,
mainly
because
of
improved
program
performance
in
spacecraft
and
advanced-technology
contracts
.

Automotive
sales
jumped
16
%
to
$
791
million
,
mainly
because
of
higher
sales
of
air
bags
and
other
passenger
restraint
systems
,
TRW
said
.

The
group
had
an
operating
profit
of
$
65
million
,
against
a
loss
of
$
13
million
a
year
earlier
.

However
,
excluding
the
year-earlier
charge
for
recall
of
steering
gear
,
operating
profit
in
the
latest
quarter
declined
14
%
,
reflecting
higher
start-up
and
product
development
expenses
in
passenger-restraint
systems
.

Materials
and
production
costs
also
rose
,
TRW
said
.

The
information
systems
segment
had
a
44
%
jump
sales
to
$
196
million
.

An
acquisition
accounted
for
half
the
sales
rise
,
TRW
said
.

Operating
profit
rose
threefold
to
$
18
million
,
from
$
6
million
.

For
the
nine
months
,
TRW
's
net
was
$
199

3.22
a

,
down
3

from

Sales
rose

a
tragicomic
monologue
by
an
idealistic
,
not
unheroic
,
though
sadly
self-deceived
English
butler
in
his
sixties
--
proceeds
as
if
the
realistic
English
novel
of
manners
,
like
Britannia
herself
,
still
ruled
the
waves
.

In
fact
,
Kazuo
Ishiguro
's
``
The
Remains
of
the
Day
''
(
Knopf
,
245
pages
,
$
18.95
)
is
both
an
homage
to
traditional
English
forms
and
a
dramatic
critique
of
them
.

It
implies
that
the
British
Empire
was
rooted
in
its
subjects
'
minds
,
manners
and
morals
,
and
argues
,
tacitly
,
that
its
self-destructive
flaws
were
embodied
in
the
defensive
snobbery
,
willful
blindness
,
role-playing
and
especially
the
locutions
of
its
domestic
servants
.

As
the
narrator
Stevens
,
the
solitary
butler
of
Darlington
Hall
,
mulls
over
such
hallowed
terms
as
``
greatness
,
''
``
dignity
,
''
``
service
''
and
``
loyalty
,
''
we
see
how
pious
cant
subverts
the
soul
.

Stevens
's
dutiful
conflation
of
the
public
and
private
realms
--
like
his
beloved
master
's
--
destroys
all
it
was
designed
to
preserve
.

Such
armor
crushes
the
soldier
.

The
mask
cuts
to
the
quick
.

It
's
1956
,
the
year
the
Suez
crisis
marked
the
final
end
of
Empire
.

As
he
stands
on
a
hill
at
the
beginning
of
a
six-day
motor
expedition
from
Oxfordshire
to
Cornwall
,
where
a
former
housekeeper
resides
,
perhaps
the
victim
of
an
unhappy
20-year
marriage
,
perhaps
(
he
hopes
with
more
fervor
than
he
will
ever
acknowledge
)
not
disinclined
to
return
to
domestic
service
,
Stevens
surveys
the
view
and
thereby
provides
a
self-portrait
,
a
credo
and
the
author
's
metaphor
for
the
aesthetic
of
the
novel
we
're
reading
:

``
We
call
this
land
of
ours
Great
Britain
,
and
there
may
be
those
who
believe
this
a
somewhat
immodest
practice
.

Yet
I
would
venture
that
the
landscape
of
our
country
alone
would
justify
the
use
of
this
lofty
adjective
...
.

It
is
the
very
lack
of
obvious
drama
or
spectacle
that
sets
the
beauty
of
our
land
apart
.

What
is
pertinent
is
the
calmness
of
that
beauty
,
its
sense
of
restraint
.

It
is
as
though
the
land
knows
of
its
own
beauty
,
of
its
own
greatness
,
and
feels
no
need
to
shout
it
.

In
comparison
,
the
sorts
of
sights
offered
in
such
places
as
Africa
and
America
,
though
undoubtedly
very
exciting
,
would
,
I
am
sure
,
strike
the
objective
viewer
as
inferior
on
account
of
their
unseemly
demonstrativeness
.
''

An
effusive
landscape
?

An
ill-mannered
mountain
?

But
let
Stevens
continue
in
his
unwitting
comic
manner
(
his
conscious
efforts
at
``
banter
''
always
fail
--
most
comically
)
:
``
This
whole
question
is
very
akin
to
the
question
that
has
caused
much
debate
in
our
profession
over
the
years
:
what
is
a
`
great
'
butler
?
''

His
answer
is
one
``
possessed
of
a
dignity
in
keeping
with
his
position
.
''

Such
dignity
``
has
to
do
crucially
with
a
butler
's
ability
not
to
abandon
the
professional
being
he
inhabits
.
''

He
``
will
not
be
shaken
out
by
external
events
,
however
surprising
,
alarming
or
vexing
...
.

Continentals
are
unable
to
be
butlers
because
they
are
as
a
breed
incapable
of
the
emotional
restraint
which
only
the
English
race
are
capable
of
.
''

Despite
his
racial
advantage
,
to
be
a
great
butler
is
a
heroic
calling
;
one
's
pantry
is
``
not
unlike
general
's
headquarters
during
a
battle
.
''

If
,
for
example
,
in
the
midst
of
a
great
social
occasion
(
such
as
an
international
conference
on
revising
the
Versailles
Treaty
in
1923
)
,
one
's
72-yearold
father
,
himself
a
great
butler
once
,
should
happen
to
die
of
a
stroke
,
one
must
continue
to
serve
the
port
:
``
Please
do
n't
think
me
unduly
improper
in
not
ascending
to
see
my
father
in
his
deceased
condition
just
at
this
moment
.

You
see
,
I
know
my
father
would
have
wished
me
to
carry
on
just
now
.
''

It
is
this
kind
of
dignity
and
restraint
that
allows
Stevens
to
declare
:
``
For
all
its
sad
associations
,
whenever
I
recall
that
evening
today
,
I
find
I
do
so
with
a
large
sense
of
triumph
.
''

We
note
the
imperial
public
word
used
to
deny
private
rage
and
sorrow
.

That
Stevens
himself
is
not
grotesque
or
repellent
,
but
funny
and
sad
and
enlightening
,
is
entirely
the
author
's
triumph
.

Mr.
Ishiguro
's
ability
to
create
a
fallible
narrative
voice
that
permits
him
to
explore
such
intertwining
domestic
,
cultural
and
political
themes
was
abundantly
clear
in
his
previous
novel
,
``
An
Artist
of
the
Floating
World
,
''
set
in
Japan
after
the
war
.

Now
shifting
his
scene
from
the
country
he
left
at
five
to
the
England
he
has
lived
in
for
nearly
30
years
,
he
has
fashioned
a
novel
in
the
mode
of
Henry
James
and
E.M.
Forster
.

With
great
aplomb
he
considers
not
only
filial
devotion
and
(
utterly
repressed
)
sexual
love
,
but
British
anti-Semitism
,
the
gentry
's
impatience
with
democracy
and
support
of
Hitler
,
and
the
moral
problematics
of
loyalty
:
``
It
is
,
in
practice
,
simply
not
possible
to
adopt
such
a
critical
attitude
towards
an
employer
and
at
the
same
time
provide
good
service
...
.

`
This
employer
embodies
all
that
I
find
noble
and
admirable
.

I
will
hereafter
devote
myself
to
serving
him
.

'
This
is
loyalty
intelligently
bestowed
.
''

In
the
end
,
after
meeting
with
the
former
housekeeper
,
Stevens
sits
by
the
seashore
at
dusk
,
thinking
of
her
and
of
his
employer
,
and
declares
``
I
trusted
.

I
trusted
in
his
lordship
's
wisdom
...
.

I
ca
n't
even
say
I
made
my
own
mistakes
.

Really
--
one
has
to
ask
oneself
--
what
dignity
is
there
in
that
?
''

The
loyal
servant
has
come
full
circle
.

What
is
greatness
?

What
is
dignity
?

We
understand
such
rueful
wisdom
must
be
retrospective
:
The
owl
of
Minerva
only
spreads
her
wings
at
dusk
.

But
as
``
The
Remains
of
the
Day
''
so
eloquently
demonstrates
with
quiet
virtuosity
,
such
wisdom
can
be
movingly
embodied
in
art
.

Mr.
Locke
teaches
English
and
comparative
literature
at
Columbia
University
.

UGI
Corp.
said
its
AmeriGas
subsidiary
completed
the
previously
announced
sale
of
its
air
separation
plant
and
related
assets
in
Waukesha
,
Wis.
,
to
AGA
Gas
Inc.
,
Cleveland
.

The
price
was
n't
disclosed
.

The
transaction
is
part
of
UGI
's
continuing
program
to
shed
AmeriGas
's
industrial
gas
interests
and
expand
the
subsidiary
's
propane
business
.

Since
June
,
AmeriGas

netted
more
than
$
100
million
from
industrial
gas
divestitures
and
reinvested
more
than

Stanislav
Ovcharenko
,
who
represents
the
Soviet
airline
Aeroflot
here
,
has
some
visions
that
are
wild
even
by
the
current
standards
of
perestroika
.

In
his
office
overlooking
the
runway
of
Shannon
Airport
,
Mr.
Ovcharenko
enthusiastically
throws
out
what
he
calls
``
just
ideas
''
:

First
,
he
suggests
,
GPA
Group
Ltd.
,
the
international
aircraft
leasing
company
based
in
Ireland
,
could
lease
some
of
its
Boeing
jetliners
to
the
Soviet
airline
.

Then
Aer
Lingus
,
the
Irish
flag
carrier
,
could
teach
Aeroflot
pilots
to
fly
the
Boeings
,
and
the
fleet
could
be
based
here
at
Shannon
Airport
.

That
's
not
all
,
he
says
.

Aer
Rianta
,
the
Irish
airport
authority
,
could
build
a
cargo
terminal
in
the
Soviet
Union
.

Aeroflot
could
lease
some
of
its
cargo
planes
to
Aer
Lingus
,
through
GPA
,
for
a
joint-venture
cargo
airline
.

And
then
there
is
his
notion
of
an
Irish-Soviet
charter
airline
to
ferry
Armenians
to
Los
Angeles
via
Shannon
.

Have
the
freedoms
of
glasnost
gone
to
Mr.
Ovcharenko
's
head
?

Hardly
.

The
Irish-Soviet
aviation
connection
is
alive
and
well
here
at
Shannon
Airport
.

GPA
is
indeed
talking
about
leasing
Western
planes
to
Aeroflot
and
even
about
buying
Soviet-built
Tupolev
204s
.

Aer
Lingus
is
in
discussions
with
the
Soviet
carrier
about
a
cargo
venture
and
other
possibilities
.

Aer
Rianta
already
has
so
many
ventures
with
Aeroflot
that
its
chief
executive
is
studying
Russian
.

Unlikely
as
it
may
seem
,
tiny
,
politically
neutral
Ireland
has
penetrated
the
mighty
Soviet
airline
bureaucracy
.

And
as
Aeroflot
struggles
to
boost
its
service
standards
,
upgrade
its
fleet
and
pursue
commercial
opportunities
,
the
Irish
aviation
industry
seems
poised
to
benefit
.

``
Irish
and
Soviet
people
are
similar
,
''
says
Mr.
Ovcharenko
.

``
They
look
the
same
.

They
're
very
friendly
.
''

Moreover
,
he
says
,
Irish
companies
are
small
but
spunky
.

``
We
have
to
study
their
experience
very
well
,
''
he
says
.

``
We
must
find
any
way
to
get
business
.
''

The
two
groups
have
been
working
together
since
the
late
1970s
,
long
before
Soviet
joint
ventures
were
the
rage
in
the
West
.

Aeroflot
carried
about
125
million
passengers
last
year
,
and
Shannon
Airport
,
the
airline
's
largest
transit
airport
outside
the
Soviet
Union
,
saw
1,400
Aeroflot
flights
and
250,000
passengers
pass
through
.

An
apartment
complex
down
the
road
is
the
crew-rest
and
staging
area
for
more
than
130
Aeroflot
pilots
and
flight
attendants
.

The
airport
's
biggest
supplier
of
aircraft
fuel
is
the
Soviet
Union
.

Tankers
from
the
Latvian
port
of
Ventspils
each
year
unload
25
million
gallons
of
fuel
into
a
special
tank
farm
at
the
airport
.

What
Aeroflot
does
n't
pour
into
its
own
gas-guzzling
Ilyushins
is
bartered
to
the
airport
authority
,
which
resells
it
to
11
Western
carriers
including
Air
France
,
Trans
World
Airlines
and
Pakistan
International
Airlines
.

Aeroflot
thus
pays
its
landing
fees
,
ground-handling
and
catering
bills
with
fuel
,
preserving
its
hard
currency
.

That
is
n't
all
.

Last
year
,
the
Irish
airport
authority
,
in
a
joint
venture
with
Aeroflot
,
opened
four
hard-currency
duty-free
shops
at
Moscow
's
Sheremetyevo
Airport
.

Aer
Rianta
now
manages
duty-free
sales
on
all
Aeroflot
international
flights
out
of
Moscow
.

Duty-free
shops
in
Leningrad
's
Pulkova
Airport
opened
in
July
,
and
hard-currency
shops
in
Leningrad
hotels
and
on
the
Soviet-Finnish
frontier
are
coming
soon
.

Aer
Rianta
is
talking
about
similar
joint
ventures
in
Tashkent
and
in
Sochi
,
a
Black
Sea
resort
,
and
even
has
a
computer-assembly
project
cooking
with
the
Georgian
city
of
Tbilisi
.

Aeroflot
's
international
fleet
of
285
planes
is
being
repainted
and
refurbished
at
Shannon
Airport
.

Thanks
to
a
new
air-traffic
agreement
and
the
ability
of
Irish
travel
agents
to
issue
Aeroflot
tickets
,
tourists
here
are
taking
advantage
of
Aeroflot
's
reasonable
prices
to
board
flights
in
Shannon
for
holidays
in
Havana
,
Kingston
and
Mexico
City
.

The
round-trip
fare
to
Havana
is
410
Irish
punts
(
$
578
)
.

Jamaica
costs
504
punts
.

A
formal
blessing
of
sorts
was
bestowed
on
this
friendship
in
April
when
Mikhail
and
Raisa
Gorbachev
stopped
here
for
talks
with
Irish
Prime
Minister
Charles
Haughey
.

New
trade
accords
were
signed
.

It
all
started
with
geography
.

When
it
opened
in
1939
,
Shannon
was
the
first
landfall
in
Europe
for
thirsty
airplanes
flying
from
North
America
.

Advances
in
aircraft
fuel
efficiency
over
the
years
made
a
Shannon
stop
unnecessary
for
most
Western
air
fleets
,
but
Aeroflot
still
flies
inefficient
Ilyushins
that
ca
n't
make
it
from
Moscow
to
Managua
on
one
hop
.

As
a
result
,
Ireland
did
n't
spurn
the
Soviets
after
they
shot
down
a
Korean
Air
Lines
jetliner
over
the
Sea
of
Japan
in
1983
,
though
it
suspended
direct
Moscow-Shannon
flights
for
two
months
.

In
fact
,
Aer
Lingus
started
ferrying
Russians
from
Shannon
to
New
York
when
Washington
stripped
Aeroflot
of
its
U.S.
landing
rights
.

Today
,
Aer
Rianta
is
making
a
heap
of
money
from
its
Soviet
friendship
.

And
,
with
those
contacts
in
place
,
it
could
be
relatively
simple
to
add
Aer
Lingus
and
GPA
to
the
team
.

Then
,
perhaps
,
Mr.
Ovcharenko
's
ideas
would
n't
sound
like
so
much
blarney
.

Britain
's
industrial
production
rose
1.5
%
in
August
from
July
and
was
up
0.9
%
from
August
1988
,
according
to
provisional
data
from
the
Central
Statistical
Office
.

Output
in
the
energy
sector
,
which
can
vary
greatly
with
swings
in
the
oil
market
,
rose
3.8
%
in
August
from
May
but
was
down
7.1
%
from
a
year
earlier
.

The
latest
figures
compare
with
July
's
4.5
%
month-to-month
rise
and
11.3
%
year-to-year
fall
.

When
Nucor
Corp.
begins
shipping
steel
from
the
world
's
first
thin-slab
plant
this
month
,
it
will
begin
testing
the
competitive
mettle
of
its
giant
competitors
.

The
new
technology
,
which
creates
a
very
thin
piece
of
steel
,
radically
reduces
the
costs
of
making
flat-rolled
sheets
.

An
ebullient
Kenneth
Iverson
,
Nucor
's
chairman
,
says
the
company
's
plant
eventually
will
make
a
ton
of
steel
in
1.5
man
hours
,
compared
with
four
to
six
man
hours
at
a
conventional
mill
.

``
We
've
had
the
Russians
and
Chinese
,
and
people
from
India
visiting
us
,
''
Mr.
Iverson
beams
.

``
Everyone
in
the
world
is
watching
us
very
closely
.
''

Especially
his
neighbors
,
the
major
U.S.
steelmakers
.

Already
,
USX
Corp.
and
Armco
Inc.
are
studying
Nucor
's
technology
to
see
if
they
can
adopt
it
.

Says
the
chief
executive
officer
of
a
major
Midwest
steel
company
:
``
It
's
damn
worrisome
.
''

The
once-staid
steel
industry
is
about
to
be
turned
topsy-turvy
by
a
1990s
technology
revolution
.

New
,
efficient
and
sophisticated
processes
make
it
easier
for
smaller
,
less
cash-rich
companies
to
make
steel
at
a
fraction
of
what
Big
Steel
paid
decades
ago
.

It
also
enables
minimills
finally
to
get
a
toehold
in
the
flat-rolled
steel
market
--
the
major
steelmakers
'
largest
,
most
prized
,
and
until
now
,
untouchable
,
market
.

But
such
thin-slab
technology
is
only
the
beginning
.

Eager
engineers
espouse
direct-steelmaking
and
direct
casting
,
which
by
the
end
of
the
1990s
will
enable
production
without
coke
ovens
and
blast
furnaces
.

Those
massive
structures
,
while
posing
cost
and
environmental
headaches
,
effectively
locked
out
all
but
deep-pocketed
giants
from
steelmaking
.

``
There
's
a
revolution
ahead
of
us
that
will
ultimately
change
the
way
we
market
and
distribute
steel
,
''
says
William
Dennis
,
vice
president
,
manufacturing
and
technology
,
for
the
American
Iron
Ore
and
Steel
Institute
.

It
is
n't
that
major
steelmakers
have
blithely
ignored
high
technology
.

In
fact
,
they
've
spent
billions
of
dollars
to
boost
the
percentage
of
continously
cast
steel
to
60.9
%
in
1988
,
from
39.6
%
five
years
before
.

Moreover
,
their
balance
sheets
are
rich
with
diversity
,
their
old
plants
shuttered
,
and
work
forces
lean
.

But
that
wo
n't
suffice
.

``
It
's
no
longer
enough
to
beat
the
guy
down
the
street
.

You
have
to
beat
everyone
around
the
world
,
''
says
Mr.
Dennis
.

He
wants
to
see
steelmakers
more
involved
in
computers
and
artificial
intelligence
.

The
problem
:
They
're
saddled
with
huge
plants
that
require
costly
maintenance
.

And
try
plying
new
dollars
free
in
a
market
that
is
softening
,
hurt
by
a
strong
dollar
and
concerned
about
overcapacity
--
the
industry
's
Darth
Vadar
.

``
The
technology
revolution
is
going
to
be
very
threatening
to
established
producers
,
''
says
Peter
Marcus
,
an
analyst
with
PaineWebber
Inc
.

``
They
've
got
too
much
invested
in
the
old
stuff
and
they
ca
n't
get
their
workers
to
be
flexible
.
''

No
one
expects
minimills
to
eclipse
major
integrated
steelmakers
,
who
remain
the
undisputed
kings
of
highest-quality
steel
used
for
autos
and
refrigerators
.

Nucor
's
plant
in
Crawfordsville
,
Ind.
,
ultimately
will
produce
only
one
million
tons
annually
,
a
drop
in
the
40-million-ton-a-year
flat-rolled
steel
bucket
,
and
it
will
be
years
before
such
plants
can
compete
in
the
high-profit
market
.

Still
,
flat-rolled
is
the
steel
industry
's
bread
and
butter
,
representing
about
half
of
the
80
million
tons
of
steel
expected
to
be
shipped
this
year
.

Moreover
,
the
process
is
n't
without
its
headaches
.

Because
all
operations
are
connected
,
one
equipment
failure
forces
a
complete
plant
shutdown
.

On
some
days
,
the
Nucor
plant
does
n't
produce
anything
.

``
At
this
point
,
the
minimill
capacity
wo
n't
make
a
great
dent
in
the
integrated
market
,
but
it
does
challenge
them
to
develop
new
markets
,
''
says
James
McCall
,
vice
president
,
materials
,
at
Battelle
,
a
technology
and
management-research
giant
based
in
Columbus
,
Ohio
.

Indeed
,
with
demand
for
steel
not
growing
fast
enough
to
absorb
capacity
,
steelmakers
will
have
to
change
the
way
they
do
business
.

In
the
past
,
says
Armco
's
chief
economist
John
Corey
,
steelmakers
made
a
product
and
set
it
out
on
the
loading
dock
.

``
We
said
:
`
We
've
got
a
product
:
if
you
want
it
,
you
can
buy
it
,
'
''
he
says
,
adding
:
``
Now
we
're
figuring
out
what
people
need
,
and
are
going
back
to
make
it
.
''

Armco
's
sales
representatives
visit
the
General
Motors
Corp.
's
Fairfax
assembly
plant
in
Kansas
City
,
Mo.
,
two
or
three
days
a
week
.

When
they
determined
that
GM
needed
parts
more
quickly
,
Armco
convinced
a
steel
service
center
to
build
a
processing
plant
nearby
so
shipments
could
be
delivered
within
15
minutes
.

Cementing
such
relationships
with
major
clients
--
car
and
appliance
makers
--
is
a
means
of
survival
,
especially
when
those
key
clients
are
relying
on
a
smaller
pool
of
producers
and
flirting
with
plastic
and
aluminum
makers
.

For
example
,
when
Detroit
began
talking
about
plastic-bodied
cars
,
the
American
Iron
and
Steel
Institute
began
a
major
lobbying
effort
to
show
auto
makers
how
they
could
use
steel
more
efficiently
by
simply
redesigning
how
a
car
door
is
assembled
.

But
steelmakers
must
also
find
new
markets
.

After
letting
aluminum-makers
take
the
recycling
lead
,
a
group
of
the
nation
's
largest
steelmakers
started
a
recycling
institute
to
promote
steel
cans
to
an
environmentally
conscious
nation
.

Battelle
's
Mr.
McCall
thinks
steelmakers
should
concentrate
more
on
construction
.

Weirton
Steel
Corp.
,
Weirton
,
W.
Va.
,
for
example
,
is
touting
to
homeowners
fashionable
steel
doors
,
with
leaded
glass
inserts
,
as
a
secure
and
energy-efficient
alternative
to
wooden
or
aluminum
ones
.

Other
steelmakers
envision
steel
roofs
covering
suburbia
.

Still
others
are
looking
at
overseas
markets
.

USX
is
funneling
drilling
pipe
to
steel-hungry
Soviet
Union
.

This
year
,
the
nation
's
largest
steelmaker
reactivated
its
overseas
sales
operation
.

Producers
also
are
trying
to
differentiate
by
concentrating
on
higher-profit
output
,
such
as
coated
and
electrogalvanized
products
,
which
remain
beyond
the
reach
of
minimills
.

Almost
all
capital-improvement
programs
announced
by
major
steelmakers
within
the
past
year
involve
building
electrogalvanizing
lines
,
used
to
produce
steel
for
such
products
as
household
appliances
and
car
doors
.

But
unfortunately
,
that
segment
is
much
smaller
than
the
bread-and-butter
flat-rolled
steel
.

``
It
's
like
everyone
climbing
out
of
the
QE
II
and
getting
into
a
lifeboat
,
''
says
John
Jacobson
,
an
analyst
with
AUS
Consultants
.

``
After
a
while
,
someone
has
to
go
over
the
side
.
''

Although
he
does
n't
expect
any
bankruptcies
,
he
does
see
more
plants
being
sold
or
closed
.

Robert
Crandall
,
with
the
Brookings
Institute
,
agrees
.

``
Unless
there
is
an
enormous
rate
of
economic
growth
or
a
further
drop
in
the
dollar
,
it
's
unlikely
that
consumption
of
U.S.
produced
steel
will
grow
sufficiently
to
offset
the
growth
of
minimills
.
''

Not
to
mention
the
incursion
of
imports
.

Japanese
and
European
steelmakers
,
which
have
led
the
recent
technology
developments
,
are
anxiously
awaiting
the
lifting
of
trade
restraints
in
1992
.

Moreover
,
the
U.S.
can
expect
more
competition
from
low-cost
producing
Pacific
Rim
and
Latin
American
countries
.

A
Taiwanese
steelmaker
recently
announced
plans
to
build
a
Nucor-like
plant
.

``
People
think
of
the
steel
business
as
an
old
and
mundane
smokestack
business
,
''
says
Mr.
Iverson
.

``
They
're
dead
wrong
.

Polaroid
Corp.
's
patent-infringement
damages
case
against
Eastman
Kodak
Co.
,
one
of
the
highest
stakes
corporate
trials
ever
,
is
getting
scant
attention
on
Wall
Street
.

After
78
days
of
mind-numbing
testimony
in
federal
court
in
Boston
,
the
trial
is
being
all
but
ignored
by
analysts
and
patent
attorneys
.

Most
have
read
the
pre-trial
documents
,
however
,
and
estimate
Kodak
will
be
ordered
to
pay
$
1
billion
to
$
1.5
billion
for
infringing
on
seven
Polaroid
patents
.

That
may
be
the
largest
patent
award
ever
,
but
it
is
well
below
the
$
12
billion
Polaroid
seeks
.

The
highest
patent
damage
award
to
date
was
in
1986
,
when
Smith
International
Inc.
was
ordered
to
pay
$
205
million
to
Baker
Hughes
Inc.
for
infringing
on
a
patent
on
an
oil
drilling
bit
seal
.

The
two
companies
later
agreed
to
settle
for
$
95
million
.

Few
analysts
think
it
is
worth
their
time
to
slog
through
the
Polaroid
trial
testimony
.

``
It
's
like
panning
for
gold
outside
of
Grand
Central
Station
.

You
might
find
something
,
but
the
chances
are
low
,
''
said
Michael
Ellman
,
an
analyst
at
Wertheim
Schroder
&
Co
.

And
Eugene
Glazer
,
an
analyst
at
Dean
Witter
Reynolds
Inc.
,
said
:
``
If
you
hired
an
attorney
to
be
there
all
the
time
and
give
you
a
(
prediction
)
of
the
eventual
award
,
I
would
be
willing
to
bet
that
he
would
be
off
''
by
a
lot
.

A
75-day
trial
in
the
early
1980s
determined
that
Kodak
,
based
in
Rochester
,
N.Y.
,
infringed
on
patents
of
Polaroid
,
of
Cambridge
,
Mass
.

The
main
issues
remaining
are
how
to
calculate
damages
and
whether
the
infringement
was
``
willful
and
deliberate
.
''

If
so
,
the
damages
could
be
tripled
.

Two
analysts
who
have
read
the
transcripts
,
David
Nelson
of
Shearson
Lehman
Hutton
Inc.
and
Calvert
D.
Crary
,
a
litigation
analyst
at
Labe
,
Simpson
&
Co.
,
think
Judge
A.
David
Mazzone
will
decide
in
Kodak
's
favor
on
the
``
willful
and
deliberate
''
issue
.

Mr.
Crary
said
testimony
by
Kodak
's
patent
counsel
,
Francis
T.
Carr
of
Kenyon
&
Kenyon
,
showed
that
``
he
worked
with
Kodak
continuously
from
the
outset
of
the
project
''
in
an
effort
to
avoid
infringement
.

``
Carr
told
Kodak
on
many
occasions
to
avoid
various
features
because
of
Polaroid
's
patent
positions
,
''
and
Kodak
followed
his
advice
in
every
instance
,
Mr.
Crary
said
.

But
Irving
Kayton
,
a
patent
expert
at
George
Mason
University
School
of
Law
who
is
familiar
with
the
case
,
said
the
fact
that
seven
patents
were
infringed
``
suggests
that
infringement
was
willful
.

It
's
difficult
to
be
that
consistently
wrong
.
''

Observers
also
wonder
whether
Judge
Mazzone
will
use
the
lost-profits
method
of
determining
damages
,
which
Polaroid
favors
because
it
would
result
in
a
larger
award
,
or
the
reasonable
royalty
method
.

Polaroid
claims
it
could
have
manufactured
and
sold
all
the
instant
cameras
and
film
sold
by
Kodak
if
Kodak
had
n't
entered
the
market
.

Moreover
,
Polaroid
contends
it
could
have
sold
them
at
a
higher
price
--
and
thus
made
higher
profits
--
because
it
would
n't
have
been
forced
to
match
Kodak
's
lower
prices
.

Each
side
has
called
a
Harvard
Business
School
professor
to
testify
on
that
issue
.

Kodak
hired
Robert
Buzzell
and
Polaroid
brought
in
Robert
J.
Dolan
.

``
There
's
nothing
that
says
that
people
at
Harvard
Business
school
have
to
agree
with
each
other
,
''
said
Mr.
Buzzell
.

Testimony
is
expected
to
continue
until
early
December
.

A
decision
is
n't
expected
until
some
time
next
year
.

International
Business
Machines
Corp.
said
earnings
tumbled
30
%
in
the
third
quarter
,
even
a
bit
further
than
expected
,
rendering
the
outlook
doubtful
for
the
next
few
quarters
.

The
main
reason
was
a
delay
in
shipment
of
new
high-end
disk
drives
,
a
business
that
accounts
for
some
10
%
of
IBM
's
$
60
billion
of
annual
revenue
.

IBM
,
which
telegraphed
the
poor
results
three
weeks
ago
,
also
cited
an
increase
in
its
leasing
business
,
which
tends
to
lock
in
business
long-term
but
cut
revenue
in
the
near
term
.

In
addition
,
IBM
noted
that
the
stronger
dollar
has
cut
the
value
of
overseas
revenue
and
earnings
when
they
are
translated
into
dollars
.

Earnings
fell
to
$
877
million
,
or
$
1.51
a
share
,
somewhat
below
securities
analysts
'
revised
expectations
of
around
$
1.60
a
share
.

That
compared
with
the
year-earlier
$
1.25
billion
,
or
$
2.10
a
share
--
which
was
inflated
by
a
15-cents-a-share
gain
from
the
sale
of
some
MCI
Communications
Corp.
stock
and
by
an
unspecified
amount
from
a
payment
by
Fujitsu
Ltd.
relating
to
a
software
dispute
.

Revenue
climbed
4.3
%
to
$
14.31
billion
from
$
13.71
billion
.

IBM
,
Armonk
,
N.Y.
,
remained
upbeat
.

The
computer
giant
,
whose
U.S.
results
have
been
dismal
for
years
,
noted
that
revenue
rose
again
in
the
U.S.
in
the
third
quarter
,
following
an
increase
in
the
second
period
.

The
company
said
in
a
statement
that
``
demand
for
IBM
products
and
services
continues
to
be
good
world-wide
.

We
do
not
see
anything
in
the
fundamentals
of
our
business
that
would
cause
us
to
change
our
strategy
of
investing
for
profitable
growth
.
''

Securities
analysts
,
however
,
remained
downbeat
.

``
I
think
1990
will
be
another
mediocre
year
,
''
said
Steve
Milunovich
of
First
Boston
.

Jay
Stevens
of
Dean
Witter
actually
cut
his
per-share
earnings
estimate
to
$
9
from
$
9.50
for
1989
and
to
$
9.50
from
$
10.35
in
1990
because
he
decided
sales
would
be
even
weaker
than
he
had
expected
.

Both
estimates
would
mark
declines
from
the
1988
net
of
$
5.81
billion
,
or
$
9.80
a
share
,
which
itself
was
well
below
the
record
IBM
set
in
1984
.

Mr.
Stevens
said
he
kept
a
``
buy\/hold
''
recommendation
on
the
stock
only
because
``
all
the
damage
has
been
done
.
''

He
said
the
stock
has
n't
traded
below
1
1\/2
times
book
value
over
the
past
10
years
,
which
at
the
moment
computes
to
a
stock
price
of
$
100
.

The
stock
closed
yesterday
at
$
103
a
share
,
up
just
$
1
in
composite
trading
on
the
New
York
Stock
Exchange
as
the
market
surged
.

Analysts
worry
that
the
disk-drive
and
leasing
problems
will
last
at
least
through
the
first
quarter
.

``
A
key
part
of
the
question
is
,
how
soon
does
this
disk-drive
come
and
how
soon
does
production
ramp
up
?
''
said
Steve
Cohen
at
SoundView
Financial
Group
.

``
And
the
input
I
've
had
from
customers
is
that
it
still
could
be
a
while
.
''

On
leasing
,
Bob
Djurdjevic
at
Annex
Research
said
he
thinks
IBM
has
hurt
itself
unnecessarily
.

He
said
IBM
has
priced
its
leases
aggressively
,
thinking
that
would
help
win
business
.

But
he
said
IBM
would
have
won
the
business
anyway
as
a
sale
to
a
third
party
that
would
have
then
leased
the
equipment
to
the
customer
.

He
said
IBM
has
not
only
hurt
its
short-term
revenue
outlook
but
has
also
been
losing
money
on
its
leases
.

Bob
Bardagy
,
executive
vice
president
of
marketing
at
Comdisco
Inc.
,
a
huge
leasing
firm
,
said
:
``
To
put
it
mildly
,
IBM
Credit
has
been
doing
some
of
the
worst
economic
deals
of
any
leasing
company
we
have
ever
seen
.
''

IBM
is
expected
to
get
a
boost
soon
when
it
announces
some
new
versions
of
its
mainframes
.

But
the
basic
technology
in
the
line
is
almost
five
years
old
,
which
means
it
is
long
in
the
tooth
,
and
competitors
are
rolling
out
strong
products
of
their
own
.

IBM
is
gaining
momentum
in
the
personal-computer
market
,
and
is
expected
to
introduce
some
impressive
workstations
early
next
year
.

But
it
's
hard
to
squeeze
much
profit
out
of
the
personal-computer
business
these
days
,
and
the
workstation
market
,
while
important
,
is
too
small
to
rely
on
for
much
growth
.

The
disk
drives
will
doubtless
sell
well
when
they
finally
become
available
.

But
the
AS\/400
,
IBM
's
highly
successful
minicomputer
line
,
is
losing
its
momentum
,
and
some
analysts
said
sales
could
even
decline
in
the
fourth
quarter
.

In
addition
,
IBM
's
growth
in
software
in
the
third
quarter
was
just
8.8
%
,
well
below
historical
levels
even
when
adjusted
to
reflect
last
year
's
payment
from
Fujitsu
and
the
stronger
dollar
.

And
expenses
,
up
7.9
%
in
the
quarter
,
have
stayed
stubbornly
high
.

In
the
nine
months
,
IBM
earned
$
3.17
billion
,
or
$
5.43
a
share
,
down
8.4
%
from
the
year-earlier
$
3.46
billion
,
or
$
5.83
a
share
.

Revenue
increased
6.5
%
to
$
42.25
billion
from
$
39.68
billion
.

PepsiCo
Inc.
's
chairman
said
he
is
``
more
than
comfortable
with
''
analysts
'
estimates
that
third-quarter
earnings
rose
to
at
least
98
cents
to
$
1
a
share
from
91
cents
the
year
earlier
.

D.
Wayne
Calloway
,
also
chief
executive
officer
of
the
company
,
indicated
that
he
expects
analysts
to
raise
their
forecasts
for
1989
after
the
company
releases
its
earnings
today
.

So
far
,
analysts
have
said
they
are
looking
for
$
3.30
to
$
3.35
a
share
.

After
today
's
announcement
,
that
range
could
increase
to
$
3.35
to
$
3.40
a
share
.

The
official
said
he
also
would
be
comfortable
with
that
new
range
.

In
1988
,
the
soft-drink
giant
earned
$
2.90
a
share
.

Results
for
1989
will
include
about
40
cents
a
share
from
the
dilutive
effects
of
snack-food
and
bottling
company
acquisitions
.

In
composite
trading
on
the
New
York
Stock
Exchange
,
the
company
closed
yesterday
at
$
57.125
a
share
,
up
$
3.125
.

The
company
said
third-quarter
sales
are
expected
to
increase
25
%
from
$
3.12
billion
of
last
year
's
third
quarter
.

Domestic
soft-drink
bottler
case
sales
are
estimated
to
have
risen
only
1
%
in
the
third
quarter
--
well
below
the
4
%
to
5
%
growth
of
recent
years
--
but
about
in
line
with
the
rest
of
the
soft-drink
industry
.

Mr.
Calloway
blamed
the
slower
volume
on
rainier
weather
,
a
dearth
of
new
products
in
the
industry
and
--
to
a
much
lesser
extent
--
pricing
.

PepsiCo
said
its
soft-drink
prices
were
about
2
%
higher
in
the
quarter
.

Mr.
Calloway
also
noted
that
soft-drink
volume
rose
a
hefty
9
%
in
last
year
's
third
quarter
,
making
the
comparison
more
difficult
.

International
soft-drink
volume
was
up
about
6
%
.

Snack-food
tonnage
increased
a
strong
7
%
in
the
third
quarter
,
while
domestic
profit
increased
in
double
digits
,
Mr.
Calloway
said
.

Excluding
the
British
snack-food

A

payable
Nov.

The

said
it

at
the

Hydro-Quebec
said
it
notified
Central
Maine
Power
Co.
it
will
cancel
a
$
4
billion
contract
to
supply
electricity
to
the
Maine
utility
.

The
provincially
owned
utility
said
it
is
tearing
up
the
deal
because
``
the
contract
's
objectives
ca
n't
be
fulfilled
.
''

Hydro-Quebec
said
Maine
regulators
'
refusal
to
approve
the
contract
earlier
this
year
halted
work
on
transmission
lines
and
stopped
negotiations
for
resale
of
electricity
carried
through
Maine
to
other
utilities
.

``
It
would
now
be
physically
impossible
to
begin
deliveries
in
1992
,
''
a
Hydro-Quebec
official
said
.

The
contract
was
to
run
from
1992
to
2020
.

Under
the
contract
Hydro-Quebec
was
to
supply
400
megawatts
of
power
to
Central
Maine
Power
starting
in
1992
,
600
megawatts
starting
in
1995
and
900
megawatts
starting
in

Hydro-Quebec
said
Maine
regulators
'
refusal
to
approve
the
contract
means
Central
Maine
Power
has
lost
its
place
in
line
.

``
We
wo
n't
sign
any
new
contracts
{
with
deliveries
}
beginning
earlier
than
2000
,
''
the
Hydro-Quebec
official
said
.

He
said
Hydro-Quebec
already
has
some
``
customers
in
mind
''
for
the
power
that
was
to
be
delivered
to
Maine
.

``
Nothing
has
happened
since
we
signed
the
contract
to
undermine
our
conviction
that
Hydro-Quebec
was
the
lowest-cost
,
most
environmentally
acceptable
choice
for
meeting
a
part
of
our
customers
'
energy
needs
through
the
year
2020
,
''
said
Central
Maine
senior
vice
president
Donald
F.
Kelly
.

Central
Maine
said
it
is
evaluating
``
many
energy
options
''
to
make
up
for
the
lost
future
power
,
including
new
energy
generation
and
management
proposals
from
New

,
and
possibly
new
Canadian
purchases

CHICAGO
-
Options
traders
were
among
the
big
victims
of
Friday
's
plunging
stock
market
,
including
one
small
firm
that
required
an
emergency
$
50
million
bailout
.

While
Monday
's
rebounding
markets
helped
other
investors
recoup
losses
,
many
options
customers
and
professional
traders
in
stock-index
options
and
the
options
on
takeover
stocks
were
left
with
multimillion-dollar
losses
,
traders
here
and
in
New
York
said
.

Options
traders
were
hurt
worse
than
others
on
Friday
because
of
the
highly
volatile
nature
of
options
,
which
often
rise
or
fall
in
value
several
times
the
amount
of
the
price
change
in
the
individual
stock
or
index
of
stocks
on
which
they
are
based
.

Thus
,
options
traders
Friday
were
stuck
with
losses
that
also
were
several
times
larger
than
those
suffered
by
many
stock
traders
in
New
York
.

Jeffrey
Miller
of
Miller
Tabak
Hirsch
&
Co.
said
that
given
the
high
degree
of
leverage
in
the
options
market
,
it
is
``
very
easy
for
these
guys
to
get
wiped
out
.

That
may
just
be
the
nature
of
these
highly
leveraged
little
creatures
.
''

An
options
contract
gives
the
holder
the
right
to
buy
(
call
)
or
sell
(
put
)
a
specific
amount
of
stock
,
or
in
this
case
the
value
of
a
stock
index
,
based
on
a
predetermined
price
within
a
given
time
period
.

Options
traders
who
,
in
return
for
a
small
fee
,
or
premium
,
had
previously
sold
put
options
on
stocks
or
stock
indexes
were
forced
on
Friday
to
buy
those
contracts
back
at
the
previously
agreed
prices
,
which
were
substantially
above
those
in
the
market
as
it
was
falling
.

They
then
had
no
choice
in
many
cases
but
to
sell
the
contracts
at
prevailing
prices
--
in
most
cases
at
a
substantial
loss
.

The
latest
round
of
losses
is
likely
to
be
a
serious
blow
to
the
Chicago
Board
Options
Exchange
,
which
has
never
fully
recovered
from
the
aftershock
of
Black
Monday
,
when
investors
fled
the
market
because
of
huge
losses
.

Making
matters
worse
was
the
fact
that
late
Friday
afternoon
the
CBOE
halted
stock-index
options
trading
in
step
with
the
Chicago
Mercantile
Exchange
's
halt
in
stock-index
futures
.

But
while
the
Merc
reopened
a
half
hour
later
,
the
CBOE
remained
closed
,
leaving
many
options
traders
unable
to
make
trades
that
might
have
reduced
the
losses
.

CBOE
Chairman
Alger
``
Duke
''
Chapman
,
said
that
,
unlike
the
futures
market
,
the
options
exchange
has
to
open
in
a
rotation
that
allows
each
different
options
series
to
trade
.

Exchange
officials
reasoned
that
they
would
n't
have
been
able
to
make
such
a
rotation
with
the
time
remaining
Friday
afternoon
,
and
with
the
stock-index
futures
on
the
verge
of
closing
for
a
second
and
final
time
,
the
CBOE
reasoned
that
its
best
course
was
to
remain
closed
.

The
damage
was
so
bad
at
Fossett
Corp.
,
an
options
trading
firm
here
,
that
it
was
forced
to
transfer
its
accounts
to
First
Options
of
Chicago
,
a
unit
of
Continental
Bank
Corp.
,
as
a
result
of
options
trading
losses
.

Fosset
so
far
is
the
only
member
of
a
financial
exchange
to
be
forced
to
be
taken
over
by
another
firm
as
a
result
of
Friday
's
rout
.

Fossett
still
had
several
million
dollars
in
capital
left
after
Friday
's
close
of
trading
,
but
not
enough
that
regulators
,
worried
about
another
potential
market
plunge
yesterday
,
would
let
it
reopen
for
trading
,
options
exchange
officials
said
.

Thus
,
in
an
unprecedented
arrangement
underscoring
the
seriousness
of
the
transfer
,
the
CBOE
,
the
American
Stock
Exchange
and
the
Options
Clearing
Corp.
,
as
well
as
the
firm
's
owner
,
Stephen
Fossett
,
put
up
a
total
of
$
50
million
to
guarantee
the
customer
positions
being
transferred
to
the
bank
holding
company
subsidiary
in
case
the
market
plunged
again
yesterday
.

S.
Waite
Rawls
III
,
vice
chairman
of
Continental
Bank
,
First
Options
'
parent
company
,
said
the
firm
took
on
about
160
accounts
formerly
held
by
Fossett
,
almost
all
of
them
belonging
to
professional
floor
traders
.

``
Steve
and
his
firm
were
still
worth
a
lot
of
money
,
''
Mr.
Rawls
said
.

``
A
package
of
credit
support
was
put
together
--
including
the
assets
of
Steve
and
his
firm
.
''

The
bailout
was
cobbled
together
over
the
weekend
,
with
officials
from
the
Federal
Reserve
Board
,
Securities
and
Exchange
Commission
,
Comptroller
of
the
Currency
and
Treasury
as
well
as
the
options
exchanges
.

``
It
was
great
to
have
the
luxury
of
time
,
''
Mr.
Rawls
said
.

At
one
point
,
an
options
industry
official
had
to
talk
the
Federal
Reserve
Bank
of
Chicago
's
night
watchman
into
giving
him
the
home
phone
number
of
Silas
Keene
,
Chicago
Fed
president
.

First
Options
did
n't
have
to
put
any
money
into
the
bailout
.

Yesterday
's
rally
in
the
stock
,
futures
and
options
markets
led
CBOE
and
Amex
officials
to
conclude
that
the
$
50
million
in
guarantees
almost
certainly
wo
n't
need
to
be
tapped
by
First
Options
.

The
Fossett
firm
had
some
losses
and
liquidity
problems
during
the
October
1987
crash
as
well
,
Mr.
Rawls
said
.

A
federal
official
said
that
Continental
Bank
worked
with
securities
and
banking
regulators
over
the
weekend
to
fashion
the
Fossett
bailout
,
but
that
conditions
were
n't
dictated
by
those
agencies
.

``
It
was
their
business
decision
,
''
the
official
said
.

Officials
at
Options
Clearing
Corp.
,
which
processes
all
options
trades
for
U.S.
exchanges
,
said
that
the
$
50
million
guarantee
was
unprecedented
,
but
was
necessary
to
help
insure
the
integrity
of
the
options
markets
.

``
It
was
an
extraordinary
situation
that
needed
extraordinary
steps
,
''
said
Paul
Stevens
,
OCC
president
and
chief
operating
officer
.

Mr.
Stevens
declined
to
give
the
specific
contributions
to
the
$
50
million
guarantee
from
each
participant
.

But
CBOE
and
Amex
officials
said
that
Options
Clearing
Corp.
contributed
$
20
million
to
the
guarantee
,
the
CBOE
put
up
$
8
million
,
the
Amex
added
$
4
million
and
$
18
million
came
from
Mr.
Fossett
's
own
assets
.

Mr.
Fossett
could
n't
be
reached
to
comment
.

Debora
Foster
takes
off
her
necklace
,
settles
herself
on
a
padded
chair
and
gently
leans
forward
.

With
a
jazz-piano
tape
playing
softly
in
the
background
,
the
soothing
hands
of
Sabina
Vidunas
begin
to
work
on
Ms.
Foster
's
neck
and
shoulders
.

``
It
's
like
an
oasis
in
this
room
,
''
Ms.
Foster
purrs
.

The
room
in
question
is
the
directors
'
lounge
of
H.J.
Heinz
Co.
,
60
floors
above
the
bustle
of
Pittsburgh
.

There
,
amid
oil
paintings
and
marble
tables
,
massages
are
administered
every
Wednesday
.

``
On
days
that
I
'm
really
busy
,
''
says
Ms.
Foster
,
who
works
in
public
relations
for
the
company
,
``
it
seems
decadent
to
take
time
off
for
a
massage
.
''

Although
such
sessions
may
never
replace
coffee
breaks
,
on-site
massage
,
as
it
is
known
in
the
trade
,
is
certainly
infiltrating
corporate
America
.

In
some
companies
middle
managers
sneak
massage
therapists
into
the
office
,
fearful
that
upper-level
executives
wo
n't
approve
.

Ms.
Foster
's
indulgence
is
nothing
like
the
oily
,
hour-long
rubfests
enjoyed
by
spa
visitors
.

Nor
does
it
at
all
resemble
(
despite
what
some
executives
think
)
the
more
intimate
variety
offered
at
specialty
parlors
in
bad
parts
of
town
.

On
the
contrary
,
office
rubdowns
usually
take
place
in
dimly
lighted
conference
rooms
,
where
stressed-out
employees
relax
in
specially
designed
chairs
,
fully
clothed
.

The
massages
last
15
minutes
and
typically
cost
about
$
10
.

Some
companies
,
including
Heinz
,
even
pay
part
of
the
fee
.

Ms.
Vidunas
has
been
seeing
some
15
clients
a
visit
since
the
program
was
started
at
Heinz
last
year
.

Anthony
J.F.
O'Reilly
,
the
company
's
chairman
,
swears
by
her
firm
touch
,
saying
regular
massages
are
a
balm
for
his
old
football
injuries
.

Massage
advocates
say
that
kneading
the
head
,
shoulders
,
neck
and
back
can
go
a
long
way
toward
easing
tension
and
improving
morale
.

They
also
insist
that
touching
is
a
basic
need
,
as
powerful
as
the
need
for
food
or
sleep
,
and
that
the
office
is
as
good
a
place
as
any
to
do
it
.

``
The
blood
flows
to
your
head
,
you
feel
lightheaded
and
you
do
n't
feel
tension
around
the
head
or
neck
,
''
says
Minnie
Morey
,
an
operations
supervisor
at
the
Social
Security
office
in
Grand
Rapids
,
Mich.
,
where
massages
began
last
month
.

``
When
you
leave
the
room
after
your
massage
,
people
say
you
look
like
you
're
glowing
.
''

Adds
Candice
Ohlman
,
the
35-year-old
masseuse
who
plies
her
trade
in
the
Grand
Rapids
office
,
``
They
fall
in
love
with
my
hands
.
''

Not
everyone
,
however
,
is
at
ease
with
office
massage
.

Three
years
ago
,
the
Internal
Revenue
Service
's
office
in
San
Jose
,
Calif.
,
opened
its
doors
to
on-site
massage
.

And
even
though
employees
paid
the
bill
,
taxpayers
grumbled
.

``
Sometimes
,
with
the
release
of
stress
,
you
hear
`
oohs
'
and
`
ahs
'
coming
out
of
the
room
,
''
explains
Morgan
Banks
,
the
agency
's
health
specialist
.

``
And
you
ca
n't
have
taxpayers
coming
into
an
audit
hearing
`
oohs
'
and
`
ahs
.
'
''

Last
month
,
the
complaints
intensified
and
the
massages
ended
.

``
Now
we
're
looking
for
a
room
with
thicker
walls
,
''
Ms.
Banks
says
.

Massage
also
has
an
image
problem
to
contend
with
.

Some
masseurs
have
tried
to
get
around
this
by
calling
themselves
``
bodyworkers
''
and
describing
their
office
visits
as
``
reinvigoration
breaks
.
''

But
massage
,
no
matter
how
chaste
,
is
still
associated
in
many
minds
with
seedy
fronts
for
prostitution
,
and
that
makes
some
executives
nervous
.

Last
year
,
the
research
and
development
division
of
Weyerhaeuser
Co.
,
the
large
wood-products
concern
,
invited
a
masseuse
to
its
Tacoma
,
Wash.
,
offices
.

Phil
Harms
,
a
software
engineer
,
was
an
eager
customer
.

``
You
build
up
a
lot
of
tension
working
at
a
terminal
all
day
,
''
he
says
.

But
after
about
eight
months
,
the
vice
president
of
the
division
,
Ed
Soule
,
learned
about
the
sessions
and
brought
them
to
a
halt
.

Mr.
Soule
says
his
only
beef
was
that
the
massages
were
being
given
in
a
company
conference
room
;
the
department
's
supervised
health
facility
would
have
been
fine
.

``
In
my
view
,
{
massages
}
should
be
managed
with
an
appropriate
mixture
of
males
and
females
around
,
''
he
says
.

Given
such
attitudes
,
some
corporate
masseurs
prefer
to
go
about
their
business
quietly
.

Russell
Borner
of
Park
Ridge
,
N.J.
,
says
he
has
been
working
for
the
past
year
at
a
huge
chemical
and
manufacturing
concern
in
New
York
--
unbeknownst
to
the
company
's
executives
.

He
visits
the
same
department
every
two
or
three
weeks
.

His
massage
chair
is
kept
in
a
closet
,
and
a
secretary
escorts
him
past
security
.

``
This
is
common
with
a
lot
of
large
companies
,
''
says
Mr.
Borner
,
who
worked
for
American
Telephone
&
Telegraph
Co.
for
23
years
before
choosing
his
current
trade
.

Managers
,
he
contends
,
``
are
afraid
how
they
're
going
to
look
in
the
eyes
of
their
peers
.

My
vision
is
to
change
human
consciousness
towards
touch
.

My
attitude
is
:
Let
's
come
out
of
the
closet
.
''

Occasionally
,
all
that
's
needed
is
a
little
coaxing
.

,
by
providing
documents
and

articles
trumpeting
the
therapeutic
benefits
of
massage
.

She
notes
that
she
also
stresses
professionalism
during
her
weekly
visits
.

``
I
pull
my
hair
back
,
wear
a
little
makeup
and
look
corporate
,
''
says
Ms.
Byler
,
who
has
been
visiting
Emerson
since
January
.

``
If
I
go
in
there
as
I
normally

they
'd
ask

`
Who
is
this

''

The
self-proclaimed
father
of
on-site
massage
is
David
Palmer
,
a
41-year-old
San
Francisco
masseur
whose
mission
is
to
save
the
touch-starved
masses
.

To
help
do
this
,
Mr.
Palmer
developed
a
portable
massage
chair
three
years
ago
that
he
hopes
will
bring
``
structured
touching
''
into
mainstream
America
.

``
The
culture
is
not
ready
to
take
off
its
clothes
,
lie
down
and
be
touched
for
an
hour
for
$
45
,
''
he
says
.

``
The
idea
is
to
keep
the
clothes
on
and
to
keep
people
seated
.

The
chair
is
a
way
to
package
massage
.
''

Sitting
in
one
of
Mr.
Palmer
's
chairs
,
which
cost
$
425
and
have
since
been
copied
by
others
,
is
a
bit
like
straddling
a
recliner
.

Customers
lean
forward
,
rest
their
knees
on
side
supports
and
bury
their
face
in
padding
on
the
back
of
the
chair
.

masseuse

says

the
odd-looking
contraption

of
the
Spanish
Inquisition
.

Mr.
Palmer
,
who
serves
as
president
of
the
On-Site
Massage
Association
and
writes
an
industry
newsletter
,
says
some
4,000
practitioners
--
out
of
about
50,000
certified
masseurs
across
the
country
--
now
use
massage
chairs
in
the
workplace
,
as
well
as
on
street
corners
,
in
airports
and
malls
,
and
at
conventions
and
other
gatherings
where
weary
people
can
be
found
.

Scot
MacInnis
,
a
masseur
in
Boulder
,
Colo.
,
had
a
scary
experience
while
massaging
a
man
in
a
natural-foods
supermarket
as
part
of
a
store
promotion
.

Three
minutes
into
the
massage
,
the
man
curled
up
,
began
shaking
and
turned
red
.

Paramedics
were
called
.

A
week
later
,
the
man
told
Mr.
MacInnis
he
had
suffered
a
mild
heart
attack
unrelated
to
the
massage
.

``
It
was
a
powerful
point
in
my
career
,
''
says
the
31-year-old
Mr.
MacInnis
,
who
has
since
taken
out
a
$
1
million
liability
policy
for
his
business
.

``
But
he
pulled
through
,
and
after
the
ambulance
left
,
there
were
still
six
people
in
line
waiting
for
a
massage
.

The
next
woman
was
older
,
and
I
was
afraid
to
touch
her
.

But
it
's
like
falling
off
a
horse
and
getting
back
on
.
''

Despite
the
number
of
fans
that
office
massage
has
won
,
some
purists
look
down
on
it
,
arguing
that
naked
,
full-body
rubs
are
the
only
way
to
go
.

Linda
Aldridge
,
who
does
full-body
work
in
Pittsburgh
,
says
that
while
on-site
massage
is
better
than
nothing
,
tired
workers
should
realize
it
is
only
the
tip
of
the
iceberg
.

``
Whole
areas
of
their
bodies
are
neglected
,
''
she
says
,
adding
that
clothes
ruin
the
experience
.

``
There
's
nothing
like
skin
to
skin

In
what
is
believed
to
be
the
first
cancellation
of
a
loan
to
China
since
the
June
4
killings
in
Beijing
,
an
international
bank
syndicate
has
terminated
a
$
55
million
credit
for
a
Shanghai
property
project
.

The
syndicate
,
led
by
Schroders
Asia
Ltd.
,
agreed
last
November
to
provide
the
loan
to
Asia
Development
Corp.
,
a
U.S.
property
developer
.

But
several
weeks
ago
,
in
the
wake
of
the
Beijing
killings
,
the
loan
was
canceled
,
according
to
bankers
and
executives
close
to
the
project
.

Asia
Development
and
Schroders
declined
to
comment
on
the
move
.

Lenders
had
doubts
about
the
project
even
before
June
4
,
but
the
harsh
crackdown
,
which
caused
many
businesses
to
reassess
their
China
transactions
,
``
gave
the
banks
the
out
they
wanted
,
''
says
an
official
close
to
the
Shanghai
venture
.

The
decision
to
cancel
the
loan
exemplifies
the
tough
attitude
bankers
have
taken
toward
China
since
June
4
.

While
some
commercial
lending
has
resumed
,
international
lenders
remain
nervous
about
China
's
economic
troubles
and
foreign
debt
--
$
40
billion
at
the
end
of
1988
.

Many
loans
are
being
renegotiated
,
especially
those
tied
to
the
hotel
sector
,
which
has
been
hit
hard
by
a
post-June
4
tourism
slump
.

Many
bankers
view
property-sector
loans
as
particularly
risky
.

The
canceled
Shanghai
loan
leaves
Asia
Development
,
a
small
concern
,
saddled
with
a
half-completed
32-story
apartment
building
and
heavy
debts
.

The
company
owes
$
11
million
to
the
Shui
On
Group
,
the
project
's
Hong
Kong
contractor
,
and
a
significant
,
though
unspecified
,
amount
in
legal
fees
to
Coudert
Brothers
,
a
U.S.
law
firm
,
the
sources
say
.

The
project
,
known
as
Lotus
Mansion
,
has
been
mired
in
controversy
.

When
the
loan
agreement
was
announced
,
it
was
hailed
as
one
of
the
first
Western-style
financing
transactions
ever
used
in
China
.

Unlike
most
loans
to
China
,
there
was
no
Chinese
guarantor
.

Instead
,
the
banks
secured
a
promise
from
state-owned
Bank
of
Communications
that
it
would
lend
Asia
Development
the
entire
$
55
million
at
maturity
to
finance
repayment
of
the
original
borrowing
.

The
loan
was
to
have
matured
in
just
two
to
three
years
,
as
soon
as
construction
was
completed
.

But
in
a
letter
sent
in
August
to
Asia
Development
,
Schroders
said
the
loan
was
terminated
because
the
developer
had
failed
to
deliver
adequate
financial
data
and
pay
certain
fees
to
the
loan-management
committee
on
time
,
according
to
officials
close
to
the
project
.

Creditors
involved
in
the
project
contend
,
however
,
that
the
termination
actually
had
nothing
to
do
with
these
technical
violations
.

Instead
,
the
creditors
say
,
the
loan
fell
victim
to
nervousness
about
China
's
political
turmoil
,
as
well
as
to
concern
about
the
loan
's
security
.

The
bank
syndicate
is
made
up
mostly
of
European
banks
,
but
it
includes
China
's
state-owned
Citic
Industrial
Bank
.

The
11
banks
in
the
syndicate
sustained
no
monetary
losses
because
none
of
the
credit
facility
had
been
drawn
down
.

K
mart
Corp.
agreed
to
acquire
Pace
Membership
Warehouse
Inc.
for
$
23
a
share
,
or
$
322
million
,
in
a
move
to
expand
its
presence
in
the
rapidly
growing
warehouse-club
business
.

The
proposed
merger
comes
as
K
mart
's
profit
is
declining
and
sales
at
its
core
discount
stores
are
rising
more
slowly
than
at
such
competitors
as
Wal-Mart
Stores
Inc
.

K
mart
,
based
in
Troy
,
Mich.
,
recently
said
net
income
would
fall
for
the
third
consecutive
quarter
,
after
a
16
%
drop
in
the
first
half
of
its
current
fiscal
year
.

``
The
membership
warehouse-club
concept
has
great
potential
,
''
the
company
's
chairman
,
Joseph
E.
Antonini
,
said
in
a
statement
.

Warehouse
clubs
typically
carry
general
merchandise
and
food
products
,
which
they
sell
for
close
to
wholesale
prices
in
no-frills
stores
.

Shoppers
,
many
of
whom
operate
small
businesses
,
pay
annual
membership
fees
,
which
provide
an
income
base
for
the
stores
.

K
mart
tested
the
warehouse-club
sector
last
year
with
its
acquisition
of
a
51
%
interest
in
Makro
Inc
.

But
the
Makro
chain
,
which
operates
as
a
joint
venture
between
K
mart
and
SHV
Holdings
N.V.
of
the
Netherlands
,
has
only
six
stores
and
annual
sales
that
one
analyst
estimated
at
about
$
300
million
.

Six-year-old
Pace
,
based
in
Aurora
,
Colo.
,
operates
41
warehouse-club
stores
.

The
company
had
losses
for
several
years
before
turning
profitable
in
fiscal
1988
.

In
the
year
ended
Jan.
31
,
Pace
rang
up
profit
of
$
9.4
million
,
or
72
cents
a
share
,
after
a
tax-loss
carry-forward
,
on
sales
of
$
1.3
billion
,
and
analysts
expect
its
results
to
continue
to
improve
.

``
The
company
turned
the
corner
fairly
recently
in
profitability
,
''
said
Margo
McGlade
of
PaineWebber
Inc.
,
who
had
been
forecasting
a
46
%
jump
in
Pace
's
net
income
from
operations
this
year
and
another
42
%
increase
next
year
.

``
Warehouse
productivity
is
really
beginning
to
take
off
.
''

But
some
analysts
contend
K
mart
has
agreed
to
pay
too
much
for
Pace
.

``
Even
if
you
look
at
it
as
a
turnaround
situation
,
it
's
expensive
,
''
said
Wayne
Hood
of
Prudential-Bache
Securities
Inc
.

``
In
my
opinion
,
you
would
only
pay
that
kind
of
price
if
you
were
getting
a
premier
player
in
the
industry
.
''

Ms.
McGlade
of
PaineWebber
raised
a
more
fundamental
question
about
the
deal
.

``
If
K
mart
ca
n't
get
its
act
together
in
discounting
,
why
is
it
spending
time
worrying
about
other
growing
markets
?
''

She
said
,
``
I
would
say
K
mart
's
number
one
job
is
to
address
its
market-share
loss
{
in
discount
stores
}
,
which
longer-term
will
lead
to
improved
profit
margins
.

At
that
point
,
perhaps
diversification
would
be
appropriate
.
''

But
K
mart
's
Mr.
Antonini
is
intent
on
pushing
the
company
into
new
retail
businesses
.

For
instance
,
K
mart
is
opening
big
food
and
general
merchandise
stores
,
called
hypermarkets
,
and
warehouse-type
stores
specializing
in
office
products
and
sporting
goods
.

It
also
operates
Waldenbooks
,
Pay
Less
Drug
Stores
and
Builders
Square
home
improvement
stores
.

In
composite
trading
on
the
New
York
Stock
Exchange
,
K
mart
closed
yesterday
at
$
36
a
share
,
up
12.5
cents
.

Pace
rose
$
2.625
to
close
at
$
22.125
a
share
in
national
over-the-counter
trading
.

A
K
mart
spokesman
said
the
acquisition
would
be
financed
with
short-term
borrowings
.

Under
terms
of
the
agreement
,
a
K
mart
subsidiary
will
soon
make
a
tender
offer
for
Pace
shares
.

Among
the
conditions
of
the
offer
is
that
Pace
shareholders
tender
a
majority
of
the
company
's
shares
outstanding
.

The
companies
said
Pace
would
ill
continue
to
operate
under
its
present
management
.

G.
William
Ryan
,
president
of
Post-Newsweek
Stations
,
was
named
chief
executive
officer
of
the
unit
of
this
media
company
,
effective
Jan.
1
.

He
will
succeed
Joel
Chaseman
,
who
will
remain
a
vice
president
of
the
company
and
continue
to
represent
Post-Newsweek
stations
in
several
industry
organizations
,
the
company
said
.

literally
.

Traders
nervously
watching
their
Quotron
electronic-data
machines
yesterday
morning
were
stunned
to
see
the
Dow
Jones
Industrial
Average
plummet
99
points
in
seconds
.

A
minute
later
it
soared
128
points
,
then
zoomed
back
down
113
points
,
69
below
Friday
's
close
.

``
It
was
crazy
,
''
said
Neil
Weisman
,
general
partner
of
Chilmark
Capital
Corp
.

``
It
was
like
flying
without
a
pilot
in
the
front
of
the
plane
.
''

But
those
who
said
``
This
ca
n't
be
happening
''
were
right
.

The
Quotrons
were
wrong
.

Quotron
Systems
Inc.
,
a
Citicorp
unit
,
blamed
the
30-minute
foul-up
on
``
a
timing
problem
in
our
software
''
caused
by
the
enormous
early
volume
--
about
145
million
shares
in
the
first
hour
of
New
York
Stock
Exchange
trading
.

The
prices
of
the
individual
stocks
that
make
up
the
average
were
correct
,
Quotron
said
,
but
the
average
was
wrong
.

Meanwhile
,
there
was
an
awful
lot
of
confusion
.

At
about
10:40
a.m.
on
the
over-the-counter
trading
desk
at
a
major
brokerage
firm
,
a
veteran
trader
who
buys
and
sells
some
of
the
most
active
stocks
looked
at
a
senior
official
and
asked
,
``
What
's
going
on
?

Is
the
market
up
or
down
?
''

At
the
time
,
Quotron
was
reporting
that
the
industrial
average
was
down
70
points
.

In
fact
,
it
was
up
24
.

Holly
Stark
,
a
vice
president
who
heads
the
trading
desk
at
Dillon
Read
Capital
Corp.
,
said
that
once
she
figured
out
the
Quotron
numbers
were
wrong
,
she
called
brokers
to
tell
them
.

``
It
's
been
kind
of
annoying
,
to
say
the
least
,
''
she
said
.

To
confuse
matters
further
,
when
UAL
Corp.
stock
finally
opened
on
the
New
York
Stock
Exchange
at
11:08
a.m.
,
the
price
was
listed
at
$
324.75
a
share
,
up
about
$
45
from
Friday
;
in
fact
,
its
true
price
was
$
224.75
,
down
$
55
.

That
was
the
New
York
Stock
Exchange
's
blooper
.

A
spokesman
cited
a
``
technical
error
''
and
declined
to
elaborate
.

And
there
were
other
blunders
.

When
the
market
opened
at
9:30
a.m.
EST
,
a
reporter
for
the
Reuters
newswire
miscalculated
the
industrial
average
's
drop
as
a
4
%
decline
when
it
really
was
down
0.7
%
.

``
It
was
a
case
of
human
error
,
which
we
found
almost
immediately
and
corrected
,
''
a
spokesman
for
Reuter
in
New
York
said
.

Meanwhile
,
some
currency
traders
at
West
German
banks
in
Frankfurt
said
they
sold
dollars
on
the
news
and
had
to
buy
them
back
later
at
higher
prices
.

But
it
was
the
Quotron
problems
that
had
lingering

Dillon
Read
's
Ms.
Stark
said
in
early
afternoon
that
she
was
still
viewing
prices
and
other
data
as
subject
to
verification
,
and
she
said
portfolio
managers
continued
to
question
the
numbers
they
saw
on
the
screen
.

It
was
the
second
time
in
less
than
a
week
that
Quotron
has
had
problems
calculating
the
industrial
average
.

At
the
start
of
trading
last
Wednesday
,
the
average
appeared
to
plunge
more
than
200
points
.

Actually
,
it
was
down
only
a
few
points
at
the
time
.

Quotron
said
that
snafu
,
which
lasted
nine
minutes
,
resulted
from
a
failure
to
adjust
for
a
4-for-1
stock
split
at
Philip
Morris
Cos
.

A
Quotron
spokeswoman
said
recent
software
changes
may
have
contributed
to
yesterday
's
problems
.

She
said
Quotron
switched
to
a
backup
system
until
the
problems
were
corrected
.

``
Today
of
all
days
,
''
she
lamented
.

``
The
eyes
of
the
world
were
watching
us
.

Steven
F.
Kaplan
was
named
a
senior
vice
president
of
this
graphics
equipment
company
.

He
retains
his
current
positions
as
chief
strategic
officer
of
AM
International
and
president
of
AM
Ventures
.

Houston
attorney
Dale
Friend
,
representing
a
plaintiff
in
a
damage
suit
,
says
he
has
negotiated
a
settlement
that
will
strike
a
blow
for
his
client
.

Literally
.

It
turns
out
Mr.
Friend
's
client
,
Machelle
Parks
of
Cincinnati
,
did
n't
like
the
way
defense
attorney
Tom
Alexander
acted
during
the
legal
proceedings
.

So
she
has
agreed
to
forgo
monetary
damages
against
Mr.
Alexander
's
client
in
return
for
the
right
to
punch
the
attorney
.

Ms.
Parks
's
mother
also
gets
to
cuff
Mr.
Alexander
.

So
does
Mr.
Friend
and
his
law
partner
,
Nick
Nichols
.

The
bizarre
arrangement
grows
out
of
Mr.
Alexander
's
representation
of
Derr
Construction
Co.
,
one
of
several
defendants
in
a
wrongful
death
lawsuit
brought
by
Ms.
Parks
,
the
widow
of
a
construction
worker
killed
in
January
1987
while
working
on
a
new
Houston
convention
center
.

Last
month
,
Mr.
Friend
says
,
Mr.
Alexander
's
associate
agreed
that
Derr
would
pay
$
50,000
as
part
of
an
overall
settlement
.

But
Mr.
Alexander
scuttled
the
deal
at
the
last
minute
,
angering
the
plaintiff
's
side
.

``
I
never
agreed
to
it
,
''
Mr.
Alexander
says
,
adding
that
``
it
's
not
necessary
to
pay
these
nuisance
settlements
.
''

When
Ms.
Parks
and
her
mother
heard
about
what
had
happened
,
Mr.
Friend
says
,
they
volunteered
that
they
would
like
to
give
Mr.
Alexander
a
good
walloping
.

Mr.
Friend
says
he
passed
that
along
to
his
adversary
,
and
soon
they
were
talking
about
the
ground
rules
under
which
Derr
could
keep
its
money
and
the
plaintiffs
could
take
a
shot
at
Mr.
Alexander
.

Although
time
and
place
have
yet
to
be
determined
,
some
details
are
in
place
.

Mr.
Friend
says
he
agreed
to
strike
Mr.
Alexander
above
the
belt
.

Ms.
Parks
and
her
mother
indicated
they
want
to
``
catch
him
unawares
from
behind
,
''
he
says
.

Mr.
Alexander
,
for
his
part
,
insisted
that
the
punchers
ca
n't
assign
their
pummeling
rights
to
anyone
else
,
ca
n't
use
a
blunt
instrument
and
ca
n't
take
a
running
start
.

Mr.
Alexander
says
he
regards
the
agreement
,
which
has
n't
been
submitted
to
a
judge
,
as
something
of
a
joke
.

However
,
he
acknowledges
they
``
have
the
option
of
taking
a
swat
at
me
if
they
really
want
to
.
''

Mr.
Friend
says
his
side
is
``
dead
serious
.
''

Although
they
do
n't
contemplate
delivering
any
disabling
blows
,
he
says
that
Mr.
Alexander
will
be
asked
to
sign
a
release
from
liability
,
just
in
case
.

After
two
years
of
drought
,
it
rained
money
in
the
stock-index
futures
markets
yesterday
.

As
financial
markets
rebounded
,
trading
volume
in
the
Chicago
Mercantile
Exchange
's
huge
Standard
&
Poor
's
500
stock-index
futures
pit
soared
,
reaching
near-record
levels
for
the
first
time
since
October
1987
.

The
sudden
influx
of
liquidity
enabled
several
traders
to
reap
six-figure
windfalls
in
a
matter
of
minutes
as
prices
soared
,
traders
said
.

``
Guys
were
minting
money
in
there
today
,
''
said
John
Legittino
,
a
futures
broker
for
Elders
Futures
Inc.
in
Chicago
.

The
S&P
500
futures
contract
,
which
moves
in
fractions
of
an
index
point
under
normal
conditions
,
jumped
two
to
three
points
in
seconds
early
yesterday
after
an
initial
downturn
,
then
moved
strongly
higher
the
rest
of
the
day
.

Each
index
point
represents
a
$
500
profit
for
each
S&P
500
contract
held
.

For
the
first
time
since
the
1987
crash
,
traders
said
that
they
were
able
to
trade
several
hundred
S&P
500
contracts
at
a
time
in
a
highly
liquid
market
.

Many
institutions
and
individual
investors
have
shied
away
from
stock-index
futures
,
blaming
them
for
speeding
the
stock
market
crash
on
Black
Monday
two
years
ago
.

Since
the
crash
,
many
futures
traders
have
n't
assumed
large
positions
for
fear
that
the
S&P
500
market
,
with
much
of
its
customer
order
flow
missing
,
would
dry
up
if
prices
turned
against
them
.

More
than
400
traders
jammed
the
S&P
500
futures
pit
to
await
the
opening
bell
.

Traders
were
shouting
bids
and
offers
a
full
five
minutes
before
the
start
of
trading
at
8:30
am

The
contract
fell
five
points
at
the
open
to
323.85
,
the
maximum
opening
move
allowed
under
safeguards
adopted
by
the
Merc
to
stem
a
market
slide
.

But
several
traders
quickly
stepped
up
and
bid
for
contracts
,
driving
prices
sharply
higher
.

The
market
hovered
near
Friday
's
closing
price
of
328.85
for
about
a
half
hour
,
moving
several
index
points
higher
or
lower
in
seconds
,
then
broke
higher
and
did
n't
look
back
.

The
S&P
500
contract
that
expires
in
December
closed
up
a
record
15.65
points
on
volume
of
nearly
80,000
contracts
.

``
Traders
five
feet
from
each
other
were
making
bids
and
offers
that
were
a
full
point
apart
,
''
said
one
S&P
500
broker
.

``
You
could
buy
at
the
bid
and
sell
at
the
offer
and
make
a
fortune
,
''
he
marveled
.

Several
of
Wall
Street
's
largest
securities
firms
,
including
Salomon
Brothers
Inc.
and
PaineWebber
Inc.
,
were
also
large
buyers
,
traders
said
.

Salomon
Brothers
was
among
the
largest
sellers
of
stock-index
futures
last
week
,
traders
said
.

Brokerage
firms
as
a
rule
do
n't
comment
on
their
market
activity
.

Unlike
the
week
following
Black
Monday
two
years
ago
,
individual
traders
in
the
S&P
500
pit
were
also
being
uncharacteristically
circumspect
about
their
one-day
profits
.

``
With
the
FBI
around
here
,
bragging
rights
are
a
thing
of
the
past
,
''
said
one
trader
,
referring
to
the
federal
investigation
of
futures
trading
that
so
far
has
resulted
in
46
indictments
lodged
against
individuals
on
the
Merc
and
the
Chicago
Board
of
Trade
.

The
market
for
$
200
billion
of
high-yield
junk
bonds
regained
some
of
its
footing
as
the
Dow
Jones
Industrial
Average
rebounded
from
Friday
's
plunge
.

But
the
junk
recovery
,
led
by
the
bellwether
RJR
Holdings
bonds
,
was
precarious
.

No
trading
existed
for
the
vast
majority
of
junk
bonds
,
securities
industry
officials
said
.

On
Friday
,
trading
in
practically
every
issue
ground
to
a
halt
as
potential
buyers
fled
and
brokerage
firms
were
unwilling
to
provide
bid
and
offer
prices
for
most
issues
.

``
Nothing
traded
on
Friday
,
and
people
were
n't
really
sure
where
the
market
should
have
opened
''
yesterday
,
said
Raymond
Minella
,
co-head
of
merchant
banking
at
Merrill
Lynch
&
Co
.

``
But
we
had
a
fairly
active
day
yesterday
.
''

At
Drexel
Burnham
Lambert
Inc.
,
the
leading
underwriter
of
junk
bonds
,
``
I
was
prepared
to
be
in
a
very
bad
mood
tonight
,
''
said
David
Feinman
,
a
junk
bond
trader
.

``
Now
,
I
feel
maybe
there
's
a
little
bit
of
euphoria
.
''

But
before
the
stock
market
rebounded
from
a
sharp
early
sell-off
yesterday
,
he
said
,
``
You
could
n't
buy
{
junk
bonds
}
and
you
could
n't
give
them
away
.
''

Yesterday
's
rally
was
led
by
RJR
Holdings
13
3\/4
%
bonds
,
which
initially
tumbled
three
points
,
or
$
30
for
each
$
1,000
face
amount
,
to
96
1\/4
before
rebounding
to
99
3\/4
.

Bonds
issued
by
Kroger
,
Duracell
,
Safeway
and
American
Standard
also
showed
big
gains
,
recovering
almost
all
their
losses
from
Friday
and
early
yesterday
.

But
traders
said
the
junk
bond
market
increasingly
is
separating
into
a
top-tier
group
,
in
which
trades
can
be
executed
easily
,
and
a
larger
group
of
lower-quality
bonds
in
which
liquidity
--
or
the
ability
to
trade
without
too
much
difficulty
--
has
steadily
deteriorated
this
year
.

``
Liquidity
has
n't
returned
to
the
vast
middle
ground
of
the
market
,
''
said
Mr.
Minella
of
Merrill
.

``
The
deadbeats
are
still
deadbeats
,
''
said
Mr.
Feinman
of
Drexel
.

Analysts
are
concerned
that
much
of
the
high-yield
market
will
remain
treacherous
for
investors
.

Paul
Asquith
,
associate
professor
at
the
Massachusetts
Institute
of
Technology
's
Sloan
School
of
Management
,
citing
a
pattern
of
junk-bond
default
rates
that
are
low
in
the
early
years
after
issuance
and
rise
later
,
says
,
``
We
're
now
in
a
period
where
we
're
starting
to
see
defaults
from
the
big
issue
years
of
1984
to
1986
.
''

Mark
Bachmann
,
a
senior
vice
president
at
Standard
&
Poor
's
Corp.
,
confirms
that
there
is
``
increasing
concern
about
the
future
liquidity
of
the
junk
bond
market
.
''

``
Junk
bonds
are
a
highly
stratified
market
,
''
said
Lewis
Glucksman
,
vice
chairman
of
Smith
Barney
,
Harris
Upham
&
Co
.

``
There
's
a
whole
bunch
of
stuff
that
's
money
good
and
a
whole
bunch
of
stuff
that
's
not
so
good
.
''

Analysts
at
Standard
&
Poor
's
say
junk
bond
offerings
by
``
tightly
stretched
''
issuers
seem
to
be
growing
.

Almost
$
8
billion
of
junk
bonds
that
are
considered
untradeable
include
issues
from
SCI
TV
,
Gillette
Holdings
(
not
related
to
Gillette
Co.
)
,
Interco
,
Seaman
Furniture
,
Allied
Stores
,
Federated
Department
Stores
,
National
Gypsum
,
M.D.C.
Holdings
,
Micropolis
,
Leaseway
Transportation
and
Price
Communications
.

``
You
could
still
have
some
very
bad
times
ahead
,
''
said
Mr.
Bachmann
.

``
It
's
possible
to
have
a
10
%
default
rate
in
one
year
,
because
we
're
already
seeing
big
problems
in
the
midst
of
a
pretty
strong
economy
.

I
'm
certainly
not
comfortable
saying
we
've
seen
the
bottom
.
''

But
yesterday
's
rally
among
``
good
''
junk
was
a
badly
needed
tonic
for
the
market
.

Many
issues
``
bounced
off
the
floor
,
''
Mr.
Minella
said
,
and
benchmark
junk
issues
``
recovered
all
of
their
losses
''
from
Friday
and
early
yesterday
.

In
contrast
,
he
says
,
``
The
stock
market
gained
back
only
about
half
what
it
lost
Friday
,
and
the
{
government
}
bond
market
lost
about
half
what
it
gained
Friday
.
''

Traders
said
yesterday
's
rally
was
fueled
by
insurance
companies
looking
for
bargains
after
a
drastic
slide
in
prices
the
past
month
.

In
addition
,
mutual
funds
did
n't
appear
to
be
major
sellers
of
high-yield
securities
as
was
expected
.

``
Sometimes
a
shakeout
is
healthy
,
''
said
Drexel
's
Mr.
Feinman
.

``
People
will
learn
to
be
more
circumspect
.

If
they
do
good
credit
analysis
,
they
will
avoid
the
hand
grenades
.

I
think
the
market
is
in
good
shape
.

Should
you
really
own
stocks
?

That
's
a
question
a
lot
of
people
are
asking
,
following
the
stock
market
's
stunning
display
of
volatility
.

Whipsawed
financially
and
emotionally
by
Friday
's
heartstopping
190-point
drop
in
the
Dow
Jones
Industrial
Average
and
yesterday
's
88-point
rebound
,
they
're
wondering
if
an
individual
has
any
business
being
in
the
market
.

The
answer
,
say
academic
researchers
,
money
managers
and
investment
specialists
,
is
yes
--
as
long
as
you
approach
the
stock
market
as
an
investor
.

But
,
they
say
,
people
should
n't
try
to
be
traders
,
who
buy
and
sell
in
an
effort
to
ride
the
latest
economic
trend
or
catch
the
next
hot
stock
.

The
case
for
owning
stocks
over
the
long-term
is
compelling
.

``
If
you
look
at
75
years
worth
of
investment
history
--
including
the
Great
Depression
and
every
bear
market
since
--
stocks
have
outperformed
almost
everything
an
individual
could
have
owned
by
a
long
shot
,
''
says
Barry
Berlin
,
vice
president
at
First
Wachovia
Capital
Management
.

A
dollar
invested
in
the
stock
market
in
1926
would
have
grown
to
$
473.29
by
the
end
of
last
June
,
according
to
Laurence
Siegel
,
managing
director
at
Ibbotson
Associates
Inc
.

But
a
dollar
invested
in
long-term
bonds
in
1926
would
have
grown
to
only
$
16.56
,
and
a
dollar
put
in
Treasury
bills
would
equal
a
meager
$
9.29
.

The
longer
the
time
period
,
the
less
risk
there
is
of
losing
money
in
the
stock
market
.

Over
time
,
the
odds
increasingly
favor
the
investor
with
a
diversified
portfolio
.

For
instance
,
Ken
Gregory
,
a
San
Francisco
money
manager
,
calculates
that
if
an
investor
holds
a
basket
of
stocks
that
tracks
the
Standard
&
Poor
's
500-stock
index
,
the
chance
of
losing
money
is
3
%
to
4
%
over
a
10-year
period
,
compared
with
15
%
over
three
years
and
30
%
over
one
year
.

``
If
you
do
n't
need
the
money
for
10
years
,
there
's
a
clear-cut
case
for
sticking
to
a
steady
core
of
stocks
,
''
Mr.
Gregory
says
.

Stock-market
investments
also
help
balance
the
other
assets
an
individual
owns
,
says
John
Blankenship
Jr.
,
president
of
the
Institute
of
Certified
Financial
Planners
.

Stocks
have
a
place
in
an
investors
'
portfolio
along
with
real
estate
,
bonds
,
international
securities
and
cash
,
he
says
.

There
are
some
important
caveats
:
Before
investing
in
stocks
,
individuals
should
have
at
least
three
to
six
months
of
living
expenses
set
aside
in
the
bank
,
most
investment
advisers
say
.

Individuals
also
should
focus
on
building
equity
in
a
home
,
which
provides
some
protection
against
inflation
,
as
well
as
a
nest-egg
that
can
be
cashed
in
late
in
life
to
help
cover
the
cost
of
retirement
living
.

People
also
should
n't
invest
money
in
stocks
that
they
'll
need
in
the
near
future
--
for
example
,
for
college
tuition
payments
or
retirement
expenses
.

You
may
have
to
sell
your
stocks
at
a
time
when
the
market
takes
a
plunge
,
''
says
Mr.
Blankenship
,
a
Del
Mar
,
Calif.
financial
planner
.

But
once
the
basics
are
covered
,
``
then
I
would
start
to
invest
,
even
if
it
's
as
little
as
$
1,000
,
''
says
Michael
Lipper
,
president
of
Lipper
Analytical
Services
Inc
.

He
says
individuals
should
consider
not
just
stocks
,
but
other
long-term
investments
,
such
as
high-quality
bonds
.

Despite
the
strong
case
for
stocks
,
however
,
most
pros
warn
that
individuals
should
n't
try
to
profit
from
short-term
developments
.

``
It
's
very
difficult
to
do
,
''
says
Donald
Holt
,
a
market
strategist
for
Wedbush
Morgan
Securities
,
a
Los
Angeles
brokerage
firm
.

``
Our
markets
move
so
fast
and
they
are
so
volatile
,
there
's
no
way
the
average
investor
can
compete
with
the
pros
.
''

Individual
investors
face
high
transaction
costs
of
moving
in
and
out
of
the
market
.

The
cost
of
executing
stock
orders
varies
from
brokerage
to
brokerage
and
with
the
size
of
the
order
,
but
2
%
of
the
order
's
value
is
an
average
,
says
Stephen
Boesel
,
manager
of
T.
Rowe
Price
's
Growth
and
Income
mutual
fund
.

And
assuming
their
first
investment
is
successful
,
investors
will
have
to
pay
taxes
on
their
gains
.

That
can
reduce
returns
by
a
third
or
more
,
once
local
taxes
are
included
,
Mr.
Lipper
says
.

After
that
,
individual
traders
face
the
risk
that
the
new
investment
they
choose
wo
n't
perform
well
--
so
their
trading
costs
could
be
sustained
for
nothing
.

``
It
's
very
tough
for
most
individuals
to
out-trade
the
mutual
funds
or
the
market
,
''
says
Mr.
Lipper
.

``
You
should
really
think
twice
if
you
think
you
can
out-smart
the
system
.
''

Then
,
too
,
many
individual
investors
lack
the
sturdy
emotional
makeup
professionals
say
is
needed
to
plunge
in
and
out
of
the
market
.

So
what
's
the
best
way
to
buy
stocks
?

``
Unless
an
individual
has
a
minimum
of
between
$
50,000
and
$
100,000
to
invest
in
stocks
,
he
's
still
better
off
in
mutual
funds
than
in
individual
stocks
,
in
terms
of
getting
enough
attention
from
a
competent
broker
,
''
says
Mr.
Lipper
.

Still
,
he
adds
,
``
I
could
see
owning
both
,
given
that
individuals
often
have
an
advantage
over
big
investors
in
spotting
special
situations
based
on
their
own
insights
,
''
he
adds
.

George
Douglas
,
first
vice
president
at
Drexel
Burnham
Lambert
Inc.
,
says
that
individuals
have
a
particular
edge
now
in
``
small
to
medium-size
niche
companies
with
exciting
earnings
prospects
''
--
a
traditional
stomping
ground
for
small
investors
.

This
growth
sector
,
which
usually
carries
a
price\/earnings
multiple
about
twice
that
of
the
Standard
&
Poor
's
500
,
happens
to
include
some
of
the
market
's
most
attractive
bargains
right
now
.

``
It
's
now
selling
at
a
multiple
about
even
with
the
market
,
''
says
Mr.
Douglas
.

Moreover
,
Mr.
Douglas
sees
a
revival
of
institutional
interest
in
smaller
growth
stocks
that
could
boost
the
performance
of
these
stocks
in
the
medium
term
.

Many
big
Wall
Street
brokerage
firms
who
eliminated
their
research
effort
in
stocks
of
emerging
growth
companies
a
few
years
ago
are
now
resuming
coverage
of
this
area
,
he
notes
.

``
We
're
seeing
a
real
turnaround
in
interest
in
small
growth
stocks
,
''
he
says
.

The
pros
strenuously
advise
individuals
to
stay
away
from
the
latest
investment
fad
.

They
say
that
's
especially
important
this
late
in
the
growth
phase
of
the
economic
cycle
,
when
there
's
no
robust
bull
market
to
bail
investors
out
of
their
mistakes
.

Friday
's
correction
presents
``
a
pretty
good
buying
opportunity
,
but
let
's
not
speculate
at
this
point
in
the
business
cycle
,
''
says
Carmine
Grigoli
,
chief
equity
portfolio
strategist
at
First
Boston
Corp
.

``
Buy
stocks
on
weakness
for
their
long-term
fundamentals
,
''
he
says
.

In
the
long
run
,
investment
advisers
say
,
most
investors
will
be
better
off
using
the
dollar-cost
averaging
method
of
buying
stocks
.

In
this
method
,
a
person
invests
a
regular
amount
every
month
or
quarter
into
the
stock
market
whether
the
market
is
up
or
down
.

That
cuts
the
risk
,
Mr.
Gregory
,
the
San
Francisco
money
manager
,
points
out
.

``
When
the
market
is
low
,
you
are
buying
more
shares
,
and
when
it
's
high
,
you
're
buying
fewer
shares
,
''
he
says
.

Otherwise
,
if
you
put
all
your
money
in
at
one
time
,
by
sheer
bad
luck
,
you
might
pick
a
terrible
time
,
and
have
to
wait
three
years
to
get
even
,
Mr.
Gregory
says
.

A
disciplined
program
will
work
the
best
,
Mr.
Boesel
says
.

``
One
of
the
hardest
things
to
do
is
to
buy
stocks
when
the
market
is
down
,
''
he
says
.

``
But
that
's
just
the
time
when
you
should
be
buying
them
.

Donald
Trump
,
who
faced
rising
doubt
about
his
bid
for
American
Airlines
parent
AMR
Corp.
even
before
a
United
Airlines
buy-out
came
apart
Friday
,
withdrew
his
$
7.54
billion
offer
.

Separately
,
bankers
representing
the
group
trying
to
buy
United
's
parent
UAL
Corp.
met
with
other
banks
about
reviving
that
purchase
at
a
lower
price
,
possibly
around
$
250
a
share
,
or
$
5.65
billion
.

But
a
lower
bid
could
face
rejection
by
the
UAL
board
.

Mr.
Trump
,
who
vowed
Wednesday
to
``
go
forward
''
with
the
bid
,
said
he
was
dropping
it
``
in
light
of
the
recent
change
in
market
conditions
.
''

He
said
he
might
now
sell
his
AMR
stake
,
buy
more
shares
,
or
make
another
offer
at
a
lower
price
.

The
Manhattan
real-estate
developer
acted
after
the
UAL
buyers
failed
to
obtain
financing
for
their
earlier
$
300-a-share
bid
,
which
sparked
a
selling
panic
among
that
snowballed
into
a
190-point
drop
Friday
in
the
Dow
Jones
Industrial
Average
.

News
about
UAL
and
AMR
,
whose
shares
never
reopened
after
trading
was
halted
Friday
for
the
UAL
announcement
,
sent
both
stocks
nosediving
in
composite
trading
on
the
New
York
Stock
Exchange
.

UAL
tumbled
$
56.875
to
$
222.875
on
volume
of
2.3
million
shares
,
and
AMR
declined
by
$
22.125
to
$
76.50
as
4.7
million
shares
changed
hands
.

Together
,
the
two
stocks
wreaked
havoc
among
takeover
stock
traders
,
and
caused
a
7.3
%
drop
in
the
Dow
Jones
Transportation
Average
,
second
in
size
only
to
the
stock-market
crash
of
Oct.
19
,
1987
.

Some
said
Friday
's
market
debacle
had
given
Mr.
Trump
an
excuse
to
bail
out
of
an
offer
that
showed
signs
of
stalling
even
before
problems
emerged
with
the
UAL
deal
.

After
reaching
an
intraday
high
of
$
107.50
the
day
Mr.
Trump
disclosed
his
bid
Oct.
5
,
AMR
's
stock
had
retreated
as
low
as
$
97.75
last
week
.

Some
takeover
stock
traders
had
been
betting
against
Mr.
Trump
because
he
has
a
record
of
disclosing
stakes
in
companies
that
are
potential
takeover
targets
,
then
selling
at
a
profit
without
making
a
bid
.

``
He
still
has
n't
proven
his
mettle
as
a
big-league
take-out
artist
,
''
said
airline
analyst
Kevin
Murphy
of
Morgan
Stanley
&
Co
.

``
He
's
done
this
thing
where
he
'll
buy
a
little
bit
of
a
company
and
then
trade
out
of
it
.

He
's
written
this
book
,
`
The
Art
of
the
Deal
.
'

Why
does
n't
he
just
follow
through
on
one
of
these
things
?
''

Mr.
Trump
withdrew
his
bid
before
the
AMR
board
,
which
is
due
to
meet
tomorrow
,
ever
formally
considered
it
.

AMR
had
weighed
a
wide
range
of
possible
responses
,
from
flat
rejection
to
recapitalizations
and
leveraged
buy-outs
that
might
have
included
either
employees
,
a
friendlier
buyer
such
as
Texas
billionaire
Robert
Bass
,
or
both
.

AMR
had
also
sought
to
foil
Mr.
Trump
in
Congress
by
lobbying
for
legislation
that
would
have
bolstered
the
authority
of
the
Transportation
Department
to
reject
airline
buy-outs
.

Yesterday
,
Mr.
Trump
tried
to
put
the
blame
for
the
collapse
of
the
UAL
deal
on
Congress
,
saying
it
was
rushing
through
a
bill
to
protect
AMR
executives
.

``
I
believe
that
the
perception
that
legislation
in
this
area
may
be
hastily
approved
contributed
to
the
collapse
of
the
UAL
transaction
,
and
the
resulting
disruption
in
the
financial
markets
experienced
this
past
Friday
,
''
Mr.
Trump
wrote
members
of
Congress
.

AMR
declined
to
comment
,
and
Mr.
Trump
did
n't
respond
to
requests
for
interviews
.

Mr.
Trump
never
said
how
much
AMR
stock
he
had
bought
,
only
that
his
holdings
were
``
substantial
.
''

However
,
he
only
received
federal
clearance
to
buy
more
than
$
15
million
of
the
stock
on
Sept.
20
,
when
the
price
rose
$
2
a
share
to
$
78.50
.

Between
then
and
his
bid
on
Oct.
5
,
the
price
fluctuated
between
$
75.625
and
$
87.375
.

In
an
attempt
to
persuade
investors
that
his
bid
was
n't
just
``
a
stock
play
,
''
Mr.
Trump
promised
last
week
to
notify
the
market
before
selling
any
shares
.

AMR
was
trading
at
around
$
84
yesterday
before
his
withdrawal
announcement
,
then
immediately
fell
to
about
$
76
.

Assuming
that
he
paid
a
rough
average
price
of
$
80
a
share
,
and
assuming
he
did
n't
sell
before
his
announcement
reached
the
market
,
Mr.
Trump
could
be
sitting
with
a
modest
loss
with
the
stock
at
$
76.50
.

Some
analysts
said
AMR
Chairman
Robert
Crandall
might
seize
the
opportunity
presented
by
the
stock
price
drop
to
protect
the
nation
's
largest
airline
with
a
defensive
transaction
,
such
as
the
sale
of
stock
to
a
friendly
holder
or
company
employees
.

However
,
other
knowledgeable
observers
said
they
believed
Mr.
Crandall
and
the
AMR
board
might
well
decide
to
tough
it
out
without
taking
any
extra
steps
.

Some
analysts
said
they
believed
Mr.
Trump
,
whose
towering
ego
had
been
viewed
by
some
as
a
reason
to
believe
he
would
n't
back
out
,
might
come
back
with
a
lower
bid
.

Ray
Neidl
of
Dillon
Read
&
Co.
said
Mr.
Trump
``
is
stepping
back
and
waiting
for
the
dust
to
settle
.

I
'm
sure
he
still
wants
AMR
.
''

But
others
remained
skeptical
.

``
I
was
never
sure
Donald
Trump
really
wanted
to
take
AMR
,
''
said
John
Mattis
,
a
bond
analyst
with
Shearson
Lehman
Hutton
Inc
.

``
What
happened
with
United
was
a
gracious
way
for
him
to
bow
out
.
''

Mr.
Trump
never
obtained
financing
for
his
bid
.

That
skepticism
would
leave
him
with
an
even
greater
credibility
problem
should
he
return
that
would
handicap
him
in
any
effort
to
oust
the
board
in
a
proxy
fight
.

Meanwhile
,
Citicorp
and
Chase
Manhattan
Corp.
,
the
two
lead
lenders
on
the
UAL
buy-out
,
met
with
other
banks
yesterday
to
determine
if
they
would
be
willing
to
finance
the
buy-out
at
a
lower
price
.

Officials
familiar
with
the
talks
said
Citicorp
had
discussed
lowering
the
offer
to
$
250
a
share
,
but
said
that
price
was
a
talking
point
and
that
no
decision
has
been
made
.

At
$
250
a
share
,
the
group
would
have
to
borrow
about
$
6.1
billion
from
banks
.

The
first
UAL
deal
unraveled
after
Citibank
and
Chase
could
n't
raise
$
7.2
billion
.

Citibank
and
Chase
had
agreed
to
commit
$
3
billion
,
and
said
they
were
``
highly
confident
''
of
raising
another
$
4.2
billion
.

Together
,
Citicorp
and
Chase
received
$
8
million
in
fees
to
raise
the
rest
of
the
financing
.

But
other
banks
balked
at
the
low
interest
rate
and
banking
fees
the
UAL
group
was
willing
to
pay
them
.

Officials
familiar
with
the
bank
talks
said
the
UAL
buy-out
group
--
UAL
pilots
,
management
,
and
British
Airways
PLC
--
is
now
willing
to
pay
higher
bank
fees
and
interest
,
but
is
n't
likely
to
boost
its
$
965
million
equity
contribution
.

Nor
is
the
group
likely
to
come
forward
with
a
revised
offer
within
the
next
48
hours
despite
the
hopes
of
many
traders
.

The
group
's
advisers
want
to
make
certain
they
have
firm
bank
commitments
the
second
time
around
.

Even
if
the
buy-out
group
is
able
to
obtain
financing
,
the
transaction
still
faces
obstacles
.

UAL
's
board
could
reject
the
new
price
as
too
low
,
especially
since
there
are
n't
any
competing
bids
.

Los
Angeles
investor
Marvin
Davis
,
whose
$
275-a-share
offer
was
rejected
by
UAL
's
board
,
has
n't
shown
signs
of
pursuing
a
$
300-a-share
back-up
bid
he
made
last
month
.

In
addition
,
the
coalition
of
labor
and
management
,
longtime
enemies
who
joined
forces
only
under
the
threat
of
Mr.
Davis
's
bid
,
could
break
apart
now
.

The
group
's
resilience
gets
its
first
test
today
when
30
top
pilot
union
leaders
convene
outside
Chicago
in
a
previously
scheduled
meeting
.

Union
Chairman
F.C
.
(
Rick
)
Dubinsky
faces
the
tough
task
of
explaining
why
banks
refused
to
finance
a
buy-out
the
members
approved
overwhelmingly
last
week
.

The
pilot
union
is
vowing
to
pursue
an
acquisition
whatever
the
board
decides
.

But
if
the
board
rejects
a
reduced
bid
and
decides
to
explore
other
alternatives
,
it
could
transform
what
has
been
a
harmonious
process
into
an
adversarial
one
.

The
pilots
could
play
hardball
by
noting
they
are
crucial
to
any
sale
or
restructuring
because
they
can
refuse
to
fly
the
airplanes
.

If
they
were
to
insist
on
a
low
bid
of
,
say
$
200
a
share
,
the
board
might
n't
be
able
to
obtain
a
higher
offer
from
other
bidders
because
banks
might
hesitate
to
finance
a
transaction
the
pilots
oppose
.

Also
,
because
UAL
Chairman
Stephen
Wolf
and
other
UAL
executives
have
joined
the
pilots
'
bid
,
the
board
might
be
forced
to
exclude
him
from
its
deliberations
in
order
to
be
fair
to
other
bidders
.

That
could
cost
him
the
chance
to
influence
the
outcome
and
perhaps
join
the
winning
bidder
.

The
economy
's
temperature
will
be
taken
from
several
vantage
points
this
week
,
with
readings
on
trade
,
output
,
housing
and
inflation
.

The
most
troublesome
report
may
be
the
August
merchandise
trade
deficit
due
out
tomorrow
.

The
trade
gap
is
expected
to
widen
to
about
$
9
billion
from
July
's
$
7.6
billion
,
according
to
a
survey
by
MMS
International
,
a
unit
of
McGraw-Hill
Inc.
,
New
York
.

Thursday
's
report
on
the
September
consumer
price
index
is
expected
to
rise
,
although
not
as
sharply
as
the
0.9
%
gain
reported
Friday
in
the
producer
price
index
.

That
gain
was
being
cited
as
a
reason
the
stock
market
was
down
early
in
Friday
's
session
,
before
it
got
started
on
its
reckless
190-point
plunge
.

Economists
are
divided
as
to
how
much
manufacturing
strength
they
expect
to
see
in
September
reports
on
industrial
production
and
capacity
utilization
,
also
due
tomorrow
.

Meanwhile
,
September
housing
starts
,
due
Wednesday
,
are
thought
to
have
inched
upward
.

``
There
's
a
possibility
of
a
surprise
''
in
the
trade
report
,
said
Michael
Englund
,
director
of
research
at
MMS
.

A
widening
of
the
deficit
,
if
it
were
combined
with
a
stubbornly
strong
dollar
,
would
exacerbate
trade
problems
--
but
the
dollar
weakened
Friday
as
stocks
plummeted
.

In
any
event
,
Mr.
Englund
and
many
others
say
that
the
easy
gains
in
narrowing
the
trade
gap
have
already
been
made
.

``
Trade
is
definitely
going
to
be
more
politically
sensitive
over
the
next
six
or
seven
months
as
improvement
begins
to
slow
,
''
he
said
.

Exports
are
thought
to
have
risen
strongly
in
August
,
but
probably
not
enough
to
offset
the
jump
in
imports
,
economists
said
.

Views
on
manufacturing
strength
are
split
between
economists
who
read
September
's
low
level
of
factory
job
growth
as
a
sign
of
a
slowdown
and
those
who
use
the
somewhat
more
comforting
total
employment
figures
in
their
calculations
.

The
wide
range
of
estimates
for
the
industrial
output
number
underscores
the
differences
:
The
forecasts
run
from
a
drop
of
0.5
%
to
an
increase
of
0.4
%
,
according
to
MMS
.

A
rebound
in
energy
prices
,
which
helped
push
up
the
producer
price
index
,
is
expected
to
do
the
same
in
the
consumer
price
report
.

The
consensus
view
expects
a
0.4
%
increase
in
the
September
CPI
after
a
flat
reading
in
August
.

Robert
H.
Chandross
,
an
economist
for
Lloyd
's
Bank
in
New
York
,
is
among
those
expecting
a
more
moderate
gain
in
the
CPI
than
in
prices
at
the
producer
level
.

``
Auto
prices
had
a
big
effect
in
the
PPI
,
and
at
the
CPI
level
they
wo
n't
,
''
he
said
.

Food
prices
are
expected
to
be
unchanged
,
but
energy
costs
jumped
as
much
as
4
%
,
said
Gary
Ciminero
,
economist
at
Fleet\/Norstar
Financial
Group
.

He
also
says
he
thinks
``
core
inflation
,
''
which
excludes
the
volatile
food
and
energy
prices
,
was
strong
last
month
.

He
expects
a
gain
of
as
much
as
0.5
%
in
core
inflation
after
a
summer
of
far
smaller
increases
.

Housing
starts
are
expected
to
quicken
a
bit
from
August
's
annual
pace
of
1,350,000
units
.

Economists
say
an
August
rebound
in
permits
for
multifamily
units
signaled
an
increase
in
September
starts
,
though
activity
remains
fairly
modest
by
historical
standards
.

Assuming
the
stock
market
does
n't
crash
again
and
completely
discredit
yuppies
and
trading
rooms
,
American
television
audiences
in
a
few
months
may
be
seeing
Britain
's
concept
of
both
.

``
Capital
City
''
is
a
weekly
series
that
premiered
here
three
weeks
ago
amid
unprecedented
hype
by
its
producer
,
Thames
Television
.

The
early
episodes
make
you
long
for
a
rerun
of
the
crash
of
1987
.

Let
's
make
that
1929
,
just
to
be
sure
.

According
to
the
program
's
publicity
prospectus
,
``
Capital
City
,
''
set
at
Shane
Longman
,
a
fictional
mid-sized
securities
firm
with
#
500
million
capital
,
``
follows
the
fortunes
of
a
close-knit
team
of
young
,
high-flying
dealers
,
hired
for
their
particular
blend
of
style
,
genius
and
energy
.

But
with
all
the
money
and
glamour
of
high
finance
come
the
relentless
pressures
to
do
well
;
pressure
to
pull
off
another
million
before
lunch
;
pressure
to
anticipate
the
market
by
a
fraction
of
a
second
...
''

You
need
n't
be
a
high-powered
securities
lawyer
to
realize
the
prospectus
is
guilty
of
less
than
full
disclosure
.

The
slickly
produced
series
has
been
criticized
by
London
's
financial
cognoscenti
as
inaccurate
in
detail
,
but
its
major
weakness
is
its
unrealistic
depiction
of
the
characters
'
professional
and
private
lives
.

Turned
loose
in
Shane
Longman
's
trading
room
,
the
yuppie
dealers
do
little
right
.

Judging
by
the
money
lost
and
mistakes
made
in
the
early
episodes
,
Shane
Longman
's
capital
should
be
just
about
exhausted
by
the
final
13th
week
.

In
the
opening
episode
we
learn
that
Michelle
,
a
junior
bond
trader
,
has
indeed
pulled
off
another
million
before
lunch
.

Trouble
is
,
she
has
lost
it
just
as
quickly
.

Rather
than
keep
the
loss
a
secret
from
the
outside
world
,
Michelle
blabs
about
it
to
a
sandwich
man
while
ordering
lunch
over
the
phone
.

Little
chance
that
Shane
Longman
is
going
to
recoup
today
.

Traders
spend
the
morning
frantically
selling
bonds
,
in
the
belief
that
the
U.S.
monthly
trade
figures
will
look
lousy
.

Ah
,
perfidious
Columbia
!

The
trade
figures
turn
out
well
,
and
all
those
recently
unloaded
bonds
spurt
in
price
.

So
much
for
anticipating
the
market
by
a
fraction
of
a
second
.

And
a
large
slice
of
the
first
episode
is
devoted
to
efforts
to
get
rid
of
some
nearly
worthless
Japanese
bonds
(
since
when
is
anything
Japanese
nearly
worthless
nowadays
?
)
.

Surprisingly
,
Shane
Longman
survives
the
week
,
only
to
have
a
senior
executive
innocently
bumble
his
way
into
becoming
the
target
of
a
criminal
insider
trading
investigation
.

Instead
of
closing
ranks
to
protect
the
firm
's
reputation
,
the
executive
's
internal
rivals
,
led
by
a
loutish
American
,
demand
his
resignation
.

The
plot
is
thwarted
when
the
firm
's
major
stockholder
,
kelp
farming
on
the
other
side
of
the
globe
,
hurries
home
to
support
the
executive
.

But
the
investigation
continues
.

If
you
can
swallow
the
premise
that
the
rewards
for
such
ineptitude
are
six-figure
salaries
,
you
still
are
left
puzzled
,
because
few
of
the
yuppies
consume
very
conspicuously
.

In
fact
,
few
consume
much
of
anything
.

Two
share
a
house
almost
devoid
of
furniture
.

Michelle
lives
in
a
hotel
room
,
and
although
she
drives
a
canary-colored
Porsche
,
she
has
n't
time
to
clean
or
repair
it
;
the
beat-up
vehicle
can
be
started
only
with
a
huge
pair
of
pliers
because
the
ignition
key
has
broken
off
in
the
lock
.

And
it
takes
Declan
,
the
obligatory
ladies
'
man
of
the
cast
,
until
the
third
episode
to
get
past
first
base
with
any
of
his
prey
.

Perhaps
the
explanation
for
these
anomalies
is
that
class-conscious
Britain
is
n't
ready
to
come
to
terms
with
the
wealth
created
by
the
Thatcherian
free-enterprise
regime
.

After
all
,
this
is
n't
old
money
,
but
new
money
,
and
in
many
cases
,
young
money
.

This
attitude
is
clearly
illustrated
in
the
treatment
of
Max
,
the
trading
room
's
most
flamboyant
character
.

Yuppily
enough
,
he
lives
in
a
lavishly
furnished
converted
church
,
wears
designer
clothes
and
drives
an
antique
car
.

But
apparently
to
make
him
palatable
,
even
lovable
,
to
the
masses
,
the
script
inflates
pony-tailed
Max
into
an
eccentric
genius
,
master
of
11
Chinese
dialects
.

He
takes
his
wash
to
the
laundromat
,
where
he
meets
a
punky
French
girl
who
dupes
him
into
providing
a
home
for
her
pet
piranha
and
then
promptly
steals
his
car
and
dumps
it
in
Dieppe
.

In
producing
and
promoting
``
Capital
City
,
''
Thames
has
spent
about
as
much
as
Shane
Longman
loses
on
a
good
day
.

The
production
costs
are
a
not
inconsiderable
#
8
million
(
$
12.4
million
)
,
and
would
have
been
much
higher
had
not
the
cost
of
the
trading
floor
set
been
absorbed
in
the
budget
of
``
Dealers
,
''
an
earlier
made-for-TV
movie
.

Another
half
million
quid
went
for
a
volley
of
full-page
advertisements
in
six
major
British
newspapers
and
for
huge
posters
in
the
London
subway
.

These
expenses
create
a
special
incentive
for
``
Capital
City
's
''
producers
to
flog
it
,
or
a
Yank-oriented
version
of
it
,
in
America
.

Thames
's
U.S.
marketing
agent
,
Donald
Taffner
,
is
preparing
to
do
just
that
.

He
is
discreetly
hopeful
,
citing
three
U.S.
comedy
series
--
``
Three
's
Company
,
''
``
Too
Close
for
Comfort
''
and
``
Check
It
Out
''
--
that
had
British
antecedents
.

Perhaps
without
realizing
it
,
Mr.
Taffner
simultaneously
has
put
his
finger
on
the
problem
and
an
ideal
solution
:
``
Capital
City
''
should
have
been
a
comedy
,
a
worthy
sequel
to
the
screwball
British
``
Carry
On
''
movies
of
the
1960s
.

The
seeds
already
are
in
the
script
.

The
first
episode
concluded
with
a
marvelously
cute
scene
in
which
the
trading-room
crew
minded
a
baby
,
the
casualty
of
a
broken
marriage
at
the
firm
.

And
many
in
the
young
cast
bear
striking
resemblances
to
American
TV
and
movie
personalities
known
for
light
roles
.

Joanna
Kanska
looks
like
a
young
Zsa
Zsa
Gabor
;
William
Armstrong
,
who
plays
Max
,
could
pass
for
Hans
Conreid
,
and
Douglas
Hodge
(
Declan
)
for
James
Farentino
;
Rolf
Saxon
is
a
passable
Tommy
Noonan
and
Dorian
Healy
could
easily
double
for
Huntz
Hall
,
the
blank-faced
foil
of
the
Bowery
Boys
comedies
.

So
,
OK
kids
,
everybody
on
stage
for
``
Carry
On
Trading
''
:
The
cast
is
frantically
searching
the
office
for
misplaced
Japanese
bonds
that
suddenly
have
soared
in
value
because
Dai-Ichi
Kangyo
Bank
has
just
bought
the
White
House
.

The
pressure
is
too
much
for
Zsa
Zsa
,
who
slaps
a
security
guard
.

He
backflips
into
a
desktop
computer
terminal
,
which
explodes
,
covering
Huntz
Hall
's
face
with
microchips
.

And
all
the
while
,
the
bonds
are
in
the
baby
's
diaper
.

It
should
run
forever
.

Mr.
Rustin
is
senior
correspondent
in
the
Journal
's
London
bureau
.

Axa-Midi
Assurances
of
France
gave
details
of
its
financing
plans
for
its
proposed
$
4.5
billion
acquisition
of
Farmers
Group
Inc.
,
in
amended
filings
with
insurance
regulators
in
the
nine
U.S.
states
where
Farmers
operates
.

The
proposed
acquisition
is
part
of
Sir
James
Goldsmith
's
unfriendly
takeover
attempt
for
B.A.T
Industries
PLC
,
the
British
tobacco
,
retailing
,
paper
and
financial
services
concern
that
is
parent
of
Los
Angeles-based
Farmers
.

In
an
attempt
to
appease
U.S.
regulators
'
concern
over
a
Goldsmith
acquisition
of
Farmers
,
Sir
James
in
August
agreed
to
sell
Farmers
to
Axa
if
he
is
successful
in
acquiring
B.A.T
.

As
part
of
the
agreement
,
Axa
agreed
to
invest
$
1
billion
in
Hoylake
Investments
Ltd.
,
Sir
James
's
acquisition
vehicle
.

Of
the
total
$
5.5
billion
to
be
paid
to
Hoylake
by
Axa
,
about
$
1
billion
will
come
from
available
resources
of
Axa
's
parent
,
Axa-Midi
Group
,
$
2.25
billion
will
be
in
the
form
of
notes
issued
by
Axa
,
and
the
remaining
$
2.25
billion
will
be
in
long-term
bank
loans
.

In
an
interview
Thursday
,
Claude
Bebear
,
chairman
and
chief
executive
officer
of
Axa
,
said
his
group
has
already
obtained
assurances
from
a
group
of
banks
led
by
Cie
.
Financiere
de
Paribas
that
they
can
provide
the
loan
portion
of
the
financing
.

The
other
banking
companies
in
the
group
are
Credit
Lyonnais
,
Societe
Generale
,
BankAmerica
Corp.
and
Citicorp
,
he
said
.

Mr.
Bebear
said
Axa-Midi
Group
has
``
more
than
$
2.5
billion
of
non-strategic
assets
that
we
can
and
will
sell
''
to
help
pay
off
debt
from
the
acquisition
.

He
said
the
assets
to
be
sold
would
be
``
non-insurance
''
assets
,
including
a
beer
company
and
a
real
estate
firm
,
and
would
n't
include
any
pieces
of
Farmers
.

``
We
wo
n't
put
any
burden
on
Farmers
,
''
he
said
.

The
amended
filings
also
point
out
that
under
a
new
agreement
,
Hoylake
has
an
absolute
obligation
to
sell
Farmers
to
Axa
upon
an
acquisition
of
B.A.T
.

``
We
hope
that
with
what
we
did
,
the
regulators
will
not
need
to
evaluate
Hoylake
,
and
they
can
directly
look
at
the
agreement
with
us
,
because
Hoylake
wo
n't
be
an
owner
of
Farmers
at
anytime
,
''
Mr.
Bebear
said
.

Any
change
of
control
in
Farmers
needs
approval
of
the
insurance
commissioners
in
the
nine
states
where
Farmers
and
its
related
companies
are
incorporated
.

The
amended
filings
were
required
because
of
the
new
agreement
between
Axa
and
Hoylake
,
and
to
reflect
the
extension
that
Sir
James
received
last
month
under
British
takeover
rules
to
complete
his
proposed
acquisition
.

Hoylake
dropped
its
initial
#
13.35
billion
(
$
20.71
billion
)
takeover
bid
after
it
received
the
extension
,
but
said
it
would
launch
a
new
bid
if
and
when
the
propsed
sale
of
Farmers
to
Axa
receives
regulatory
approval
.

A
spokesman
for
B.A.T
said
of
the
amended
filings
that
,
``
It
would
appear
that
nothing
substantive
has
changed
.

The
new
financing
structure
is
still
a
very-highly
leveraged
one
,
and
Axa
still
plans
to
take
out
75
%
of
Farmers
'
earnings
as
dividends
to
service
their
debt
.
''

That
dividend
is
almost
double
the
35
%
currently
taken
out
of
Farmers
by
B.A.T
,
the
spokesman
added
.

``
It
would
have
severe
implications
for
Farmers
'
policy
holders
.
''

To
fend
off
Sir
James
's
advances
,
B.A.T
has
proposed
a
sweeping
restructuring
that
would
pare
it
to
a
tobacco
and
financial
services
concern
.

Dismal
sales
at
General
Motors
Corp.
dragged
the
U.S.
car
and
truck
market
down
below
year-ago
levels
in
early
October
,
the
first
sales
period
of
the
1990
model
year
.

The
eight
major
domestic
auto
makers
sold
160,510
North
American-made
cars
in
the
first
10
days
of
October
,
a
12.6
%
drop
from
a
year
earlier
.

Domestically
built
truck
sales
were
down
10.4
%
to
86,555
pickups
,
vans
and
sport
utility
vehicles
.

The
heavy
use
of
incentives
to
clear
out
1989
models
appears
to
have
taken
the
steam
,
at
least
initially
,
out
of
1990
model
sales
,
which
began
officially
Oct.
1
.

This
appears
particularly
true
at
GM
,
which
had
strong
sales
in
August
and
September
but
saw
its
early
October
car
and
truck
results
fall
26.3
%
from
last
year
's
unusually
high
level
.

Overall
,
sales
of
all
domestic-made
vehicles
fell
11.9
%
from
a
year
ago
.

Without
GM
,
overall
sales
for
the
other
U.S.
automakers
were
roughly
flat
with
1989
results
.

Some
of
the
U.S.
auto
makers
have
already
adopted
incentives
on
many
1990
models
,
but
they
may
have
to
broaden
their
programs
to
keep
sales
up
.

``
We
've
created
a
condition
where
,
without
incentives
,
it
's
a
tough
market
,
''
said
Tom
Kelly
,
sales
manager
for
Bill
Wink
Chevrolet
in
Dearborn
,
Mich
.

Car
sales
fell
to
a
seasonally
adjusted
annual
selling
rate
of
5.8
million
vehicles
,
the
lowest
since
October
1987
.

The
poor
performance
contrasts
with
a
robust
selling
rate
of
almost
eight
million
last
month
.

Furthermore
,
dealers
contacted
late
last
week
said
they
could
n't
see
any
immediate
impact
on
sales
of
Friday
's
steep
market
decline
.

GM
's
domestic
car
sales
dropped
24.3
%
and
its
domestic
trucks
were
down
an
even
steeper
28.7
%
from
the
same
period
a
year
ago
.

All
of
the
GM
divisions
except
Cadillac
showed
big
declines
.

Cadillac
posted
a
3.2
%
increase
despite
new
competition
from
Lexus
,
the
fledging
luxury-car
division
of
Toyota
Motor
Corp
.

Lexus
sales
were
n't
available
;
the
cars
are
imported
and
Toyota
reports
their
sales
only
at
month-end
.

The
sales
drop
for
the
No.
1
car
maker
may
have
been
caused
in
part
by
the
end
in
September
of
dealer
incentives
that
GM
offered
in
addition
to
consumer
rebates
and
low-interest
financing
,
a
company
spokesman
said
.

Last
year
,
GM
had
a
different
program
in
place
that
continued
rewarding
dealers
until
all
the
1989
models
had
been
sold
.

Aside
from
GM
,
other
car
makers
posted
generally
mixed
results
.

Ford
Motor
Co.
had
a
1.8
%
drop
in
domestic
car
sales
but
a
2.4
%
increase
in
domestic
truck
sales
.

Chrysler
Corp.
had
a
7.5
%
drop
in
car
sales
,
echoing
its
generally
slow
performance
all
year
.

However
,
sales
of
trucks
,
including
the
company
's
popular
minivans
,
rose
4.3
%
.

Honda
Motor
Co.
's
sales
of
domestically
built
vehicles
plunged
21.7
%
from
a
year
earlier
.

Honda
's
plant
in
Marysville
,
Ohio
,
was
gearing
up
to
build
1990
model
Accords
,
a
Honda
spokesman
said
.

``
We
're
really
confident
everything
will
bounce
back
to
normal
,
''
he
added
.

Separately
,
Chrysler
said
firm
prices
on
its
1990-model
domestic
cars
and
minivans
will
rise
an
average
of
5
%
over
comparably
equipped
1989
models
.

Firm
prices
were
generally
in
line
with
the
tentative
prices
announced
earlier
this
fall
.

At
that
time
,
Chrysler
said
base
prices
,
which
are
n't
adjusted
for
equipment
changes
,
would
rise
between
4
%
and
9
%
on
most
vehicle
.

Antonio
L.
Savoca
,
66
years
old
,
was
named
president
and
chief
executive
officer
of
the
Atlantic
Research
Corp.
subsidiary
.

Mr.
Savoca
had
been
a
consultant
to
the
subsidiary
's
rocket-propulsion
operations
.

Mr.
Savoca
succeeds
William
H.
Borten
,
who
resigned
to
pursue
personal
interests
.

Sequa
makes
and
repairs
jet
engines
.

It
also
has
interests
in
military
electronics
and
electro-optics
,
marine
transportation
and
machinery
used
to
make
food
and
beverage
cans
.

It
was
n't
so
long
ago
that
a
radio
network
funded
by
the
U.S.
Congress
--
and
originally
by
the
Central
Intelligence
Agency
--
was
accused
by
officials
here
of
employing
propagandists
,
imperialists
and
spies
.

Now
,
the
network
has
opened
a
news
bureau
in
the
Hungarian
capital
.

Employees
held
an
open
house
to
celebrate
and
even
hung
out
a
sign
:
``
Szabad
Europa
Radio
''
--
Radio
Free
Europe
.

``
I
think
this
is
a
victory
for
the
radio
,
''
says
Barnabas
de
Bueky
,
a
55-year-old
former
Hungarian
refugee
who
works
in
the
Munich
,
West
Germany
,
headquarters
as
deputy
director
of
the
Hungarian
service
.

In
fact
,
the
network
hopes
to
set
up
offices
in
Warsaw
and
anywhere
else
in
the
East
Bloc
that
will
have
it
.

But
the
rapid
changes
brought
on
by
glasnost
and
open
borders
are
altering
the
network
's
life
in
more
ways
than
one
.

In
fact
,
Radio
Free
Europe
is
in
danger
of
suffering
from
its
success
.

While
the
network
currently
can
operate
freely
in
Budapest
,
so
can
others
.

In
addition
,
competition
for
listeners
is
getting
tougher
in
many
ways
than
when
broadcasting
here
was
strictly
controlled
.

Instead
of
being
denounced
as
an
evil
agent
of
imperialism
,
Radio
Free
Europe
is
more
likely
to
draw
the
criticism
that
its
programs
are
too
tame
,
even
boring
.

``
They
have
a
lot
to
do
these
days
to
compete
with
Hungarian
radio
,
''
says
Andrew
Deak
,
a
computer-science
student
at
the
Technical
University
in
Budapest
.

``
The
Hungarian
{
radio
}
reporters
seem
better
informed
and
more
critical
about
about
what
's
going
on
here
.
''

Indeed
,
Hungary
is
in
the
midst
of
a
media
explosion
.

Boys
on
busy
street
corners
peddle
newspapers
of
every
political
stripe
.

Newsstands
are
packed
with
a
colorful
array
of
magazines
.

Radio
and
television
are
getting
livelier
and
bolder
.

The
British
Broadcasting
Corp.
and
the
U.S.
State
Department
's
Voice
of
America
broadcast
over
Hungarian
airwaves
,
though
only
a
few
hours
a
day
each
in
Hungarian
.

Australian
press
magnate
Rupert
Murdoch
has
bought
50
%
stakes
in
two
popular
and
gossipy
Hungarian
newspapers
,
while
Britain
's
Robert
Maxwell
has
let
it
be
known
here
that
he
is
thinking
about
similar
moves
.

But
Radio
Free
Europe
does
n't
plan
to
fade
away
.

With
its
mission
for
free
speech
and
the
capitalist
way
,
the
network
's
staff
says
it
still
has
plenty
to
do
--
in
Hungary
and
in
the
``
Great
Eastern
Beyond
.
''

Radio
Free
Europe
and
its
sister
station
for
the
Soviet
Union
,
Radio
Liberty
,
say
they
wo
n't
cut
back
their
more
than
19
hours
of
daily
broadcasts
.

They
are
still
an
important
source
of
news
for
60
million
listeners
in
23
exotic
tongues
:
from
Bulgarian
and
Belorussian
to
Kazakh
and
Kirghiz
.

The
establishment
of
its
first
bureau
in
Warsaw
Pact
territory
shows
the
depth
of
some
of
the
changes
in
Eastern
Europe
.

Months
before
the
decision
by
the
Hungarian
Communist
Party
to
rename
itself
Socialist
and
try
to
look
more
appealing
to
voters
,
the
country
's
rulers
were
trying
to
look
more
hospitable
.

It
proved
a
perfect
time
for
Radio
Free
Europe
to
ask
for
permission
to
set
up
office
.

Not
only
did
the
Hungarian
Ministry
of
Foreign
Affairs
approve
Radio
Free
Europe
's
new
location
,
but
the
Ministry
of
Telecommunications
did
something
even
more
amazing
:
``
They
found
us
four
phone
lines
in
central
Budapest
,
''
says
Geza
Szocs
,
a
Radio
Free
Europe
correspondent
who
helped
organize
the
Budapest
location
.

``
That
is
a
miracle
.
''

It
's
a
far
cry
from
the
previous
treatment
of
the
network
,
which
had
to
overcome
jamming
of
its
frequencies
and
intimidation
of
local
correspondents
(
who
filed
reports
to
the
network
by
phone
,
secret
messengers
or
letters
)
.

In
fact
,
some
of
the
network
's
Hungarian
listeners
say
they
owe
Radio
Free
Europe
loyalty
because
it
was
responsible
in
many
ways
for
keeping
hope
alive
through
what
one
writer
here
calls
the
``
Dark
Ages
of
the
20th
Century
.
''

``
During
the
past
four
years
,
many
of
us
have
sat
up
until
late
at
night
listening
to
our
radios
,
''
says
the
writer
.

``
There
were
some
very
brave
broadcasts
.
''

The
listeners
,
too
,
had
to
be
brave
.

Through
much
of
the
post-World
War
II
period
,
listening
to
Western
broadcasts
was
a
crime
in
Hungary
.

``
When
we
listen
to
the
Europe
station
,
my
mother
still
gets
nervous
,
''
says
a
Budapest
translator
.

``
She
wants
to
turn
down
the
volume
and
close
the
curtains
.
''

Now
,
the
toughest
competition
for
Radio
Free
Europe
comes
during
the
late-night
slot
.

Hungarian
radio
often
saves
its
most
politically
outspoken
broadcasts
for
around
midnight
.

Television
,
which
most
of
the
time
is
considered
rather
tame
,
has
entered
the
running
with
a
new
program
,
``
The
End
of
the
Day
,
''
which
comes
on
after
11
p.m
.

It
is
a
talk
show
with
opposition
leaders
and
political
experts
who
discuss
Hungary
's
domestic
problems
as
well
as
foreign
affairs
.

Those
who
want
to
hear
even
more
radical
views
have
to
get
up
at
five
on
Sunday
morning
for
``
Sunday
Journal
,
''
on
Hungarian
Radio
.

The
competitive
spirit
is
clearly
influencing
Radio
Free
Europe
,
which
is
trying
to
beef
up
programs
.

The
Budapest
office
plans
to
hire
free-lance
reporters
to
cover
the
latest
happenings
in
Hungarian
country
towns
from
Nagykanizsa
in
the
west
to
Nyiregyhaza
in
the
east
.

The
Hungarian
service
has
a
daily
40-minute
news
show
called
Newsreel
,
with
international
and
domestic
news
,
plus
a
daily
news
review
of
opinions
from
around
the
world
.

There
's
also
a
host
of
new
programs
,
trying
to
lighten
up
on
the
traditional
diet
of
politics
.

A
daily
35-minute
program
called
``
The
March
of
Time
''
tries
to
find
interesting
tidbits
of
lighthearted
news
and
gossip
from
around
the
world
.

There
's
a
program
for
women
and
a
science
show
.

And
to
attract
younger
listeners
,
Radio
Free
Europe
intersperses
the
latest
in
Western
rock
groups
.

The
Pet
Shop
Boys
are
big
this
year
in
Budapest
.

``
We
are
starving
for
all
the
news
,
''
says
Mr.
Deak
,
the
student
.

``
Every
moment
we
want
to
know
everything
about
the
world
.

Proposals
for
government-operated
``
national
service
,
''
like
influenza
,
flare
up
from
time
to
time
,
depress
the
resistance
of
the
body
politic
,
run
their
course
,
and
seem
to
disappear
,
only
to
mutate
and
afflict
public
life
anew
.

The
disease
metaphor
comes
to
mind
,
of
course
,
not
as
an
aspersion
on
the
advocates
of
national
service
.

Rather
,
it
is
born
of
frustration
with
having
to
combat
constantly
changing
strains
of
a
statist
idea
that
one
thought
had
been
eliminated
in
the
early
1970s
,
along
with
smallpox
.

It
is
back
with
us
again
,
in
the
form
of
legislation
to
pay
volunteers
under
a
``
National
and
Community
Service
Act
,
''
a
proposal
with
a
serious
shot
at
congressional
passage
this
fall
.

Why
does
the
national-service
virus
keep
coming
back
?

Perhaps
it
is
because
utopian
nostalgia
evokes
both
military
experience
and
the
social
gospel
.

If
only
we
could
get
America
's
wastrel
youth
into
at
least
a
psychic
uniform
we
might
be
able
to
teach
self-discipline
again
and
revive
the
spirit
of
giving
.

A
quarter
of
a
century
ago
national
service
was
promoted
as
a
way
of
curing
the
manifest
inequities
of
the
draft
--
by
,
of
all
things
,
expanding
the
draft
.

Those
of
us
who
resisted
the
idea
then
suspect
today
that
an
obligation
of
government
service
for
all
young
people
is
still
the
true
long-term
aim
of
many
national-service
backers
,
despite
their
protests
that
present
plans
contain
no
coercion
.

Choice
of
the
volunteer
military
in
the
1970s
seemed
to
doom
national
service
as
much
as
the
draft
.

But
the
virus
was
kept
alive
in
sociology
departments
until
a
couple
of
years
ago
,
when
it
again
was
let
loose
.

This
time
it
attempted
to
invade
two
connected
problems
,
the
rising
cost
of
higher
education
and
the
rising
expense
to
the
federal
government
of
educational
grants
and
loans
.

Why
not
keep
and
even
expand
the
loans
and
grants
,
the
advocates
reasoned
,
but
require
some
form
of
service
from
each
recipient
?

Military
service
,
moreover
,
could
be
a
national-service
option
.

Thus
,
undoubtedly
it
was
hoped
that
the
new
strain
of
national
service
would
prove
contagious
,
infecting
patriotic
conservatives
,
pay-as-you-go
moderates
,
and
idealistic
liberals
.

The
Democratic
Leadership
Council
,
a
centrist
group
sponsoring
the
plan
,
surely
thought
it
might
help
the
party
to
attract
support
,
especially
among
college
students
and
their
parents
.

A
provision
allowing
grants
to
be
applied
to
first-home
purchases
was
added
to
appeal
to
those
who
had
had
enough
of
schooling
.

The
DLC
plan
envisaged
``
volunteers
''
planting
trees
,
emptying
bedpans
,
tutoring
children
,
and
assisting
librarians
for
$
100
a
week
,
tax
free
,
plus
medical
care
.

With
a
tax-free
$
10,000
voucher
payment
at
the
end
of
each
year
,
the
volunteers
would
be
making
a
wage
comparable
to
$
17,500
a
year
.

Mind
you
,
most
of
``
the
volunteers
''
would
be
unskilled
17
-
to
18-year-olds
,
some
not
even
high
school
graduates
,
and
many
saving
money
by
living
at
home
.

They
would
be
doing
better
financially
under
national
service
than
many
taxpayers
working
at
the
same
kinds
of
jobs
and
perhaps
supporting
families
.

As
it
happened
,
political
resistance
developed
among
educational
and
minority
interests
that
count
on
the
present
education
grant
system
,
so
the
national-service
devotees
decided
to
abandon
the
supposedly
crucial
principle
of
``
give
in
order
to
get
.
''

Opposition
to
national
service
from
the
Pentagon
,
which
wants
to
protect
its
own
recruitment
process
,
also
led
to
the
military-service
option
being
dropped
.

Clearly
,
a
new
rationale
for
national
service
had
to
be
cooked
up
.

What
better
place
to
turn
than
Sen.
Edward
Kennedy
's
Labor
Committee
,
that
great
stove
of
government
expansionism
,
where
many
a
stagnant
pot
of
porridge
is
kept
on
the
back
burner
until
it
can
be
brought
forward
and
presented
as
nouvelle
cuisine
?

In
this
case
,
the
new
recipe
for
national
service
called
for
throwing
many
assorted
legislative
leftovers
into
one
kettle
:
a
demonstration
project
for
educational
aid
(
particularly
satisfying
to
the
DLC
and
Sen.
Sam
Nunn
)
,
a
similar
demonstration
program
for
youth
conservation
(
a
la
Sen.
Chris
Dodd
)
,
a
competitive
grants
program
to
states
to
spark
youth
and
senior
citizen
volunteer
projects
(
a
Kennedy
specialty
)
,
a
community
service
work-study
program
for
students
(
pleasing
to
the
palate
of
Sen.
Dale
Bumpers
,
among
others
)
,
plus
engorgement
of
the
VISTA
volunteer
program
and
the
Retired
Senior
Volunteer
,
Foster
Grandparent
,
and
Senior
Companion
programs
.

Before
the
menu
is
printed
,
the
House
may
add
more
ingredients
,
also
changing
the
initial
price
,
now
posted
at
some
$
330
million
.

It
is
widely
known
that
``
too
many
cooks
spoil
the
broth
,
''
but
that
wisdom
does
not
necessarily
reflect
the
view
of
the
cooks
,
especially
if
they
are
senators
.

The
``
omnibus
''
bill
coming
out
of
Congress
may
be
unwholesome
glop
,
but
the
assorted
chefs
are
happy
and
the
restaurant
is
pushing
the
dish
very
hard
.

The
aroma
of
patronage
is
in
the
air
.

Is
the
voluntary
sector
so
weak
that
it
needs
such
unsolicited
assistance
?

On
the
contrary
,
it
is
as
robust
as
ever
.

According
to
the
Gallup
Poll
,
American
adults
contribute
an
average
of
two
hours
a
week
of
service
,
while
financial
contributions
to
charity
in
the
1980s
have
risen
30
%
(
adjusted
for
inflation
)
.

Even
if
government
does
see
various
``
unmet
needs
,
''
national
service
is
not
the
way
to
meet
them
.

If
we
want
to
support
students
,
we
might
adopt
the
idea
used
in
other
countries
of
offering
more
scholarships
based
on
something
called
``
scholarship
,
''
rather
than
on
the
government
's
idea
of
``
service
.
''

Or
we
might
provide
a
tax
credit
for
working
students
.

What
we
do
not
need
to
do
is
start
a
war
,
and
then
try
to
justify
it
by
creating
a
GI
Bill
.

To
the
extent
we
lack
manpower
to
staff
menial
jobs
in
hospitals
,
for
example
,
we
should
raise
pay
,
pursue
labor-saving
technology
,
or
allow
more
legal
immigration
,
rather
than
overpay
high
school
graduates
as
short-term
workers
and
cause
resentment
among
permanent
workers
paid
lesser
amounts
to
do
the
same
jobs
.

Will
national
service
,
in
the
current
highly
politicized
and
opportunistic
form
exert
enough
appeal
to
get
adopted
?

Not
necessarily
.

Polls
show
wide
,
generalized
support
for
some
vague
concept
of
service
,
but
the
bill
now
under
discussion
lacks
any
passionate
public
backing
.

Nonetheless
,
Senate
Democrats
are
organizing
a
roll
of
supporting
``
associations
,
''
``
societies
''
and
``
councils
,
''
some
of
which
may
hope
to
receive
the
paid
``
volunteers
.
''

So
far
,
the
president
seems
ill-disposed
to
substitute
any
of
the
omnibus
for
his
own
free-standing
proposal
to
endow
a
``
Points
of
Light
''
foundation
with
$
25
million
to
inform
citizens
of
all
ages
and
exhort
them
to
genuine
volunteerism
.

However
,
even
this
admirable
plan
could
become
objectionable
if
the
White
House
gives
in
to
congressional
Democratic
pressure
to
add
to
the
scope
of
the
president
's
initiative
or
to
involve
the
independent
foundation
in
``
brokering
''
federal
funds
for
volunteer
projects
.

There
's
no
need
for
such
concessions
.

The
omnibus
can
be
defeated
,
the
virus
controlled
,
and
real
service
protected
.

National
service
,
the
utopian
idea
,
still
wo
n't
go
away
then
,
of
course
,
but
the
millions
of
knee-socked
youth
performing
works
of
``
civic
content
''
will
be
mobilized
only
in
the
imagination
of
their
progenitors
.

American
Physicians

Group
Inc.
said
it
purchased
about
42
%
of
Prime
Medical
Services
Inc.
for
about
$
5
million
from
Texas
American
Energy
Corp
.

American
Physicians
said
it
also
replaced
four
Texas
American
representatives
on
Prime
's
five-member
board
.

American
provides
a
variety
of
financial
services
to
doctors
and
hospitals
.

Prime
,
based
in
Bedminster
,
N.J.
,
provides
management
services
to
cardiac
rehabilitation
clinics
and
diagnostic
imaging
centers
.

For
the
year
ended
June

,
Prime
had
a
net
loss
of
$
3
million
on
sales
of
$
13.8

The
inflation-adjusted
growth
rate
for
France
's
gross
domestic
product
for
the
second
quarter
was
revised
upward
to
0.8
%
from
the
previous
three
months
from
the
initial
estimate
of
0.7
%
,
the
National
Statistics
Institute
said
.

The
state
agency
said
the
latest
revision
left
the
growth
rate
for
the
first-quarter
compared
with
the
previous
three
months
unchanged
at
1.3
%
.

If
the
economy
continues
to
expand
by
0.8
%
a
quarter
for
the
rest
of
the
year
,
it
would
leave
GDP
growth
for
all
of
1989
at
3
%
,
the
institute
said
.

That
would
be
down
from
the
3.8
%
rise
posted
in
1988
.

The
Canadian
government
announced
a
new
,
12-year
Canada

issue
that

10.5

the
first
year
.

The
annual
interest
rate
for
each
of
the
next
11
years
will
be
set
each
fall
,
when
details
of
a
new
series
are
released
.

Canada
Savings
Bonds
are
major
government
instruments
for
meeting
its
financial
requirements
.

The
government
has
about
41.4
billion
Canadian
dollars
(
US$
35.2
billion
)
of
such

currently
outstanding
.

Only
Canadian
residents
are
permitted
to
buy
Canada
Savings
Bonds
,
which
may
be
redeemed
any
time

The
debate
over
National
Service
has
begun
again
.

After
a
decade
in
which
more
than
50
localities
established
their
own
service
or
conservation
corps
and
dozens
of
school
systems
made
community
service
a
prerequisite
to
high-school
graduation
,
the
focus
has
shifted
to
Washington
.

At
least
10
bills
proposing
one
or
another
national
program
were
introduced
in
Congress
this
spring
.

One
,
co-sponsored
by
Sen.
Sam
Nunn
(
D.
,
Ga
.
)
and
Rep.
Dave
McCurdy
(
D.
,
Okla.
)
,
would
have
restricted
federal
college
subsidies
to
students
who
had
served
.

An
omnibus
bill
assembled
by
Sen.
Edward
Kennedy
(
D.
,
Mass.
)
,
and
including
some
diluted
Nunn-McCurdy
provisions
along
with
proposals
by
fellow
Democratic
Sens.
Claiborne
Pell
,
Barbara
Mikulski
and
Christopher
Dodd
,
has
been
reported
out
of
the
Senate
Labor
Committee
.

It
might
well
win
Senate
passage
.

President
Bush
has
outlined
his
own
Youth
Entering
Service
(
YES
)
plan
,
though
its
details
remain
to
be
specified
.

What
is
one
to
think
of
all
this
?

Doctrine
and
special
interests
govern
some
responses
.

People
eager
to
have
youth
``
pay
their
dues
to
society
''
favor
service
proposals
--
preferably
mandatory
ones
.

So
do
those
who
seek
a
``
re-energized
concept
of
citizenship
,
''
a
concept
imposing
stern
obligations
as
well
as
conferring
rights
.

Then
there
are
instinctive
opponents
.

To
libertarians
,
mandatory
service
is
an
abomination
and
voluntary
systems
are
illegitimate
uses
of
tax
money
.

Devotees
of
the
market
question
the
value
of
the
work
national
service
would
perform
:

If
the
market
wo
n't
pay
for
it
,
they
argue
,
it
ca
n't
be
worth
its
cost
.

Elements
of
the
left
are
also
reflexively
opposed
;
they
see
service
as
a
cover
for
the
draft
,
or
fear
the
regimentation
of
youth
,
or
want
to
see
rights
enlarged
,
not
obligations
.

But
what
about
those
of
us
whose
views
are
not
predetermined
by
formula
or
ideology
?

How
should
we
think
about
national
service
?

Let
's
begin
by
recognizing
a
main
source
of
confusion
--
``
national
service
''
has
no
agreed
meaning
.

Would
service
be
voluntary
or
compulsory
?

Short
or
long
?

Part-time
or
full-time
?

Paid
or
unpaid
?

Would
participants
live
at
home
and
work
nearby
or
live
in
barracks
and
work
on
public
lands
?

What
kinds
of
work
would
they
do
?

What
does
``
national
''
mean
?

Would
the
program
be
run
by
the
federal
government
,
by
local
governments
,
or
by
private
voluntary
organizations
?

And
who
would
serve
?

Only
males
,
as
with
the
draft
,
or
both
sexes
?

Youth
only
or
all
ages
?

Middle-class
people
,
or
poor
people
,
or
a
genuine
cross-section
?

Many
or
few
?

Those
are
not
trivial
questions
,
and
the
label
``
national
service
''
answers
none
of
them
.

Then
how
should
we
think
about
national
service
?

As
a
starting
point
,
here
are
five
propositions
:
1
.
Consider
the
ingredients
,
not
the
name
.

Ignore
``
national
service
''
in
the
abstract
;
consider
specific
proposals
.

They
will
differ
in
crucial
ways
.

2
.
``
Service
''
should
be
service
.

As
commonly
understood
,
service
implies
sacrifice
.

It
involves
accepting
risk
,
or
giving
up
income
,
or
deferring
a
career
.

It
follows
that
proposals
like
Nunn-McCurdy
,
whose
benefits
to
enrollees
are
worth
some
$
17,500
a
year
,
do
not
qualify
.

There
is
a
rationale
for
such
bills
:
Federal
subsidies
to
college
students
amount
to
``
a
GI
Bill
without
the
GI
''
;
arguably
those
benefits
should
be
earned
,
not
given
.

But
the
earnings
exceed
by
20
%
the
average
income
of
young
high-school
graduates
with
full-time
jobs
.

Why
call
that
service
?

3
.
Encouragement
is
fine
;
compulsion
is
not
.

Compelled
service
is
unconstitutional
.

It
is
also
unwise
and
unenforceable
.

(
Who
will
throw
several
hundred
thousand
refusers
in
jail
each
year
?
)

But
through
tax
policy
and
in
other
ways
the
federal
government
encourages
many
kinds
of
behavior
.

It
should
also
encourage
service
--
preferably
by
all
classes
and
all
ages
.

Its
encouragement
should
strengthen
and
not
undercut
the
strong
tradition
of
volunteering
in
the
U.S.
,
should
build
on
the
service
programs
already
in
existence
,
and
should
honor
local
convictions
about
which
tasks
most
need
doing
.

4
.
Good
programs
are
not
cheap
.

Enthusiasts
assume
that
national
service
would
get
important
work
done
cheaply
:
forest
fires
fought
,
housing
rehabilitated
,
students
tutored
,
day-care
centers
staffed
.

There
is
important
work
to
be
done
,
and
existing
service
and
conservation
corps
have
shown
that
even
youths
who
start
with
few
skills
can
do
much
of
it
well
--
but
not
cheaply
.

Good
service
programs
require
recruitment
,
screening
,
training
and
supervision
--
all
of
high
quality
.

They
involve
stipends
to
participants
.

Full-time
residential
programs
also
require
housing
and
full-time
supervision
;
they
are
particularly
expensive
--
more
per
participant
than
a
year
at
Stanford
or
Yale
.

Non-residential
programs
are
cheaper
,
but
good
ones
still
come
to
some
$
10,000
a
year
.

Are
they
worth
that
?

Evaluations
suggest
that
good
ones
are
--
especially
so
if
the
effects
on
participants
are
counted
.

But
the
calculations
are
challengeable
.

5
.
Underclass
youth
are
a
special
concern
.

Are
such
expenditures
worthwhile
,
then
?

Yes
,
if
targeted
.

People
of
all
ages
and
all
classes
should
be
encouraged
to
serve
,
but
there
are
many
ways
for
middle-class
kids
,
and
their
elders
,
to
serve
at
little
public
cost
.

They
can
volunteer
at
any
of
thousands
of
non-profit
institutions
,
or
participate
in
service
programs
required
by
high
schools
or
encouraged
by
colleges
or
employers
.

Underclass
youth
do
n't
have
those
opportunities
.

They
are
not
enrolled
in
high
school
or
college
.

They
are
unlikely
to
be
employed
.

And
they
have
grown
up
in
unprecedentedly
grim
circumstances
,
among
family
structures
breaking
down
,
surrounded
by
self-destructive
behaviors
and
bleak
prospects
.

But
many
of
them
can
be
quite
profoundly
reoriented
by
productive
and
disciplined
service
.

Some
wo
n't
accept
the
discipline
;
others
drop
out
for
other
reasons
.

But
some
whom
nothing
else
is
reaching
are
transformed
.

Learning
skills
,
producing
something
cooperatively
,
feeling
useful
,
they
are
no
longer
dependent
--
others
now
depend
on
them
.

Even
if
it
is
cheaper
to
build
playgrounds
or
paint
apartments
or
plant
dune-grass
with
paid
professionals
,
the
effects
on
the
young
people
providing
those
services
alter
the
calculation
.

Strictly
speaking
,
these
youth
are
not
performing
service
.

They
are
giving
up
no
income
,
deferring
no
careers
,
incurring
no
risk
.

But
they
believe
themselves
to
be
serving
,
and
they
begin
to
respect
themselves
(
and
others
)
,
to
take
control
of
their
lives
,
to
think
of
the
future
.

That
is
a
service
to
the
nation
.

It
is
what
federal
support
should
try
hardest
to
achieve
.

Szanton

administration
budget
official

heads
his
own
Washington-based

planning
firm

He
is
a
co-author
of
``
National
Service
:
What
Would
It
Mean
?
''

(
Lexington
Books
,
1986
)
.

Government
officials
here
and
in
other
countries
laid
plans
through
the
weekend
to
head
off
a
Monday
market
meltdown
--
but
went
out
of
their
way
to
keep
their
moves
quiet
.

Federal
Reserve
Chairman
Alan
Greenspan
was
on
the
telephones
,
making
it
clear
to
officials
in
the
U.S.
and
abroad
that
the
Fed
was
prepared
to
inject
massive
amounts
of
money
into
the
banking
system
,
as
it
did
in
October
1987
,
if
the
action
were
needed
to
prevent
a
financial
crisis
.

And
at
the
Treasury
,
Secretary
Nicholas
Brady
talked
with
friends
and
associates
on
Wall
Street
while
Assistant
Secretary
David
Mullins
carefully
analyzed
data
on
the
Friday
market
plunge
.

But
the
officials
feared
that
any
public
announcements
would
only
increase
market
jitters
.

In
addition
,
officials
at
the
Fed
and
in
the
Bush
administration
decided
that
avoiding
overt
actions
and
statements
over
the
weekend
would
give
them
more
strength
and
flexibility
should
Friday
's
market
drop
turn
into
this
morning
's
rout
.

``
The
disadvantage
at
this
point
is
that
anything
you
do
that
looks
like
you
are
doing
too
much
tends
to
reinforce
a
sense
of
crisis
,
''
said
one
government
official
,
insisting
on
anonymity
.

The
Fed
's
efforts
at
secrecy
were
partly
foiled
Sunday
morning
,
when
both
the
New
York
Times
and
the
Washington
Post
carried
stories
quoting
a
senior
Fed
official
saying
the
central
bank
was
prepared
to
pour
cash
into
the
banking
system
Monday
morning
.

Fed
Chairman
Greenspan
was
surprised
by
both
stories
,
according
to
knowledgeable
sources
,
and
insisted
he
had
n't
authorized
any
public
comment
.

Nevertheless
,
Fed
officials
acknowledged
the
stories
were
reasonably
accurate
portrayals
of
the
central
bank
's
game
plan
.

It
is
prepared
to
assume
the
same
role
it
played
in
October
1987
,
providing
money
to
the
markets
if
necessary
to
keep
the
financial
system
afloat
.

The
Fed
provides
money
to
the
banking
system
by
buying
government
securities
from
financial
institutions
.

The
reticence
of
federal
officials
was
evident
in
the
appearance
Sunday
of
Budget
Director
Richard
Darman
on
ABC
's
``
This
Week
.
''

``
Secretary
of
the
Treasury
Brady
and
Chairman
Greenspan
and
the
chairman
of
the
SEC
and
others
have
been
in
close
contact
.

I
'm
sure
they
'll
do
what
's
right
,
what
's
prudent
,
what
's
sensible
,
''
he
said
.

When
it
was
suggested
his
comment
was
a
``
non-answer
,
''
Mr.
Darman
replied
:
``
It
is
a
non-answer
.

But
,
in
this
context
,
that
's
the
smart
thing
to
do
.
''

At
the
Treasury
,
Secretary
Brady
issued
a
statement
minimizing
the
stock
market
's
drop
.

``
Today
's
stock
market
decline
does
n't
signal
any
fundamental
change
in
the
condition
of
the
economy
,
''
he
said
.

``
The
economy
remains
well-balanced
,
and
the
outlook
is
for
continued
moderate
growth
.
''

But
administration
officials
conceded
that
Friday
's
drop
carried
the
chance
of
further
declines
this
week
.

``
One
possibility
is
that
this
is
a
surgical
setback
,
reasonably
limited
in
its
breadth
,
and
not
a
major
problem
,
''
said
one
senior
administration
official
,
who
also
asked
that
he
not
be
named
.

``
The
other
is
that
we
see
another
major
disaster
,
like
two
years
ago
.

I
think
that
's
less
likely
.
''

Nevertheless
,
Fed
Chairman
Greenspan
and
Vice
Chairman
Manuel
Johnson
were
in
their
offices
Sunday
evening
,
monitoring
events
as
they
unfolded
in
markets
around
the
world
.

The
action
was
expected
to
begin
with
the
opening
of
the
New
Zealand
foreign
exchange
markets
at
5
p.m.
EST
--
when
stocks
there
plunged
--
and
to
continue
as
the
trading
day
began
later
in
the
evening
in
Tokyo
and
through
early
this
morning
in
Europe
.

Both
the
Treasury
and
the
Fed
planned
to
keep
market
rooms
operating
throughout
the
night
to
monitor
the
developments
.

In
Tokyo
,
share
prices
dropped
sharply
by
1.7
%
in
early
Monday
morning
trading
.

After
the
initial
slide
,
the
market
appeared
to
be
turning
around
but
by
early
afternoon
was
headed
lower
.

In
the
Bush
administration
,
the
lead
is
being
taken
by
Treasury
Secretary
Brady
,
Undersecretary
Robert
Glauber
and
Assistant
Secretary
Mullins
.

The
three
men
worked
together
on
the
so-called
Brady
Commission
,
headed
by
Mr.
Brady
,
which
was
established
after
the
1987
crash
to
examine
the
market
's
collapse
.

As
a
result
they
have
extensive
knowledge
in
financial
markets
,
and
financial
market
crises
.

Mr.
Brady
was
at
the
White
House
Friday
afternoon
when
the
stock
market
's
decline
began
.

He
was
quickly
on
the
phone
with
Mr.
Mullins
,
who
in
turn
was
talking
with
the
chairmen
of
the
New
York
and
Chicago
exchanges
.

Later
,
Mr.
Brady
phoned
Mr.
Greenspan
,
SEC
Chairman
Richard
Breeden
and
numerous
contacts
in
New
York
and
overseas
.

Aides
say
he
continued
to
work
the
phones
through
the
weekend
.

Administration
officials
say
President
Bush
was
briefed
throughout
Friday
afternoon
and
evening
,
even
after
leaving
for
Camp
David
.

He
had
frequent
telephone
consultations
with
Mr.
Brady
and
Michael
Boskin
,
chairman
of
the
counsel
of
economic
advisers
.

Government
officials
tried
throughout
the
weekend
to
render
a
business-as-usual
appearance
in
order
to
avoid
any
sense
of
panic
.

Treasury
Undersecretary
David
Mulford
,
for
instance
,
was
at
a
meeting
of
the
Business
Council
in
Hot
Springs
,
Va.
,
when
the
stock
market
fell
,
and
remained
there
through
the
following
day
.

And
as
of
last
night
,
Fed
Chairman
Greenspan
had
n't
canceled
his
plans
to
address
the
American
Bankers
Association
convention
in
Washington
at
10
a.m.
this
morning
.

Ironically
,
Mr.
Greenspan
was
scheduled
to
address
the
same
convention
in
Dallas
on
Oct.
20
,
1987
.

He
flew
to
Dallas
on
Oct.
19
,
when
the
market
plummeted
508
points
,
but
then
turned
around
the
next
morning
and
returned
to
Washington
without
delivering
his
speech
.

Following
is
a
weekly
listing
of
unadited
net
asset
values
of
publicly
traded
investment
fund
shares
,
reported
by
the
companies
as

Friday
's
close
.

Also
shown
is
the
closing
listed
market

or
a
dealer-to-dealer
asked

Put
down
that
phone
.

Walk
around
the
room
;
take
two
deep
breaths
.

Resist
the
urge
to
call
your
broker
and
sell
all
your
stocks
.

That
's
the
advice
of
most
investment
professionals
after
Friday
's
190-point
drop
in
the
Dow
Jones
Industrial
Average
.

No
one
can
say
for
sure
what
will
happen
today
.

And
investment
pros
are
divided
on
whether
stocks
will
perform
well
or
badly
in
the
next
six
months
.

But
they
're
nearly
unanimous
on
one
point
:
Do
n't
sell
into
a
panic
.

Investors
who
sold
everything
after
the
crash
of
1987
lived
to
regret
it
.

Even
after
Friday
's
plunge
,
the
Dow
Jones
Industrial
Average
was
48
%
above
where
it
landed
on
Oct.
19
two
years
ago
.

Panic
selling
also
was
unwise
during
other
big
declines
in
the
past
.

The
crash
of
1929
was
followed
by
a
substantial
recovery
before
the
great
Depression
and
awful
bear
market
of
the
1930s
began
.

The
``
October
massacres
''
of
1978
and
1979
were
scary
,
but
did
n't
lead
to
severe
or
sustained
downturns
.

Indeed
,
some
pros
see
Friday
's
plunge
,
plus
any
further
damage
that
might
occur
early
this
week
,
as
a
chance
for
bargain
hunting
.

``
There
has
been
a
lot
of
emotional
selling
that
presents
a
nice
buying
opportunity
if
you
've
got
the
cash
,
''
says
Stephen
B.
Timbers
,
chief
investment
officer
of
Chicago-based
Kemper
Financial
Services
Inc
.

But
most
advisers
think
the
immediate
course
for
individual
investors
should
be
to
stand
pat
.

``
When
you
see
a
runaway
train
,
''
says
Steve
Janachowski
,
partner
in
the
San
Francisco
investment
advisory
firm
Brouwer
&
Janachowski
,
``
you
wait
for
the
train
to
stop
.
''

Even
for
people
who
expect
a
bear
market
in
coming
months
--
and
a
sizable
number
of
money
managers
and
market
pundits
do
--
the
advice
is
:
Wait
for
the
market
to
bounce
back
,
and
sell
shares
gradually
during
rallies
.

The
best
thing
individual
investors
can
do
is
``
just
sit
tight
,
''
says
Marshall
B.
Front
,
executive
vice
president
and
head
of
investment
counseling
at
Stein
Roe
&
Farnham
Inc.
,
a
Chicago-based
investment
counseling
firm
that
manages
about
$
18
billion
.

On
the
one
hand
,
Mr.
Front
says
,
it
would
be
misguided
to
sell
into
``
a
classic
panic
.
''

On
the
other
hand
,
it
's
not
necessarily
a
good
time
to
jump
in
and
buy
.

``
This
is
all
emotion
right
now
,
and
when
emotion
starts
to
run
,
it
can
run
further
than
anyone
anticipates
,
''
he
said
.

``
So
it
's
more
prudent
to
wait
and
see
how
things
stabilize
.
''

Roger
Ibbotson
,
professor
of
finance
at
Yale
University
and
head
of
the
market
information
firm
Ibbotson
Associates
Inc.
,
says
,
``
My
real
advice
would
be
to
just
ride
through
it
.

Generally
,
it
is
n't
wise
to
be
in
and
out
''
of
the
stock
market
.

Mr.
Ibbotson
thinks
that
this
week
is
``
going
to
be
a
roller-coaster
week
.
''

But
he
also
thinks
it
is
``
a
good
week
to
consider
buying
.

John
Snyder

of
the
Los
Angeles
chapter
of
the
National
Association
of
Investors
Corp.
,
an
organization
of
investment
clubs
and
individual
investors
,
says
his
fellow
club
members
did
n't
sell
in
the
crash
of
1987
,
and
see
no
reason
to
sell
now
.

``
We
're
dedicated
long-term
investors
,
not
traders
,
''
he
says
.

``
We
understand
panics
and
euphoria
.

And
we
hope
to
take
advantage
of
panics
and
buy
stocks
when
they
plunge
.
''

One
camp
of
investment
pros
sees
what
happened
Friday
as
an
opportunity
.

Over
the
next
days
and
weeks
,
they
say
,
investors
should
look
for
stocks
to
buy
.

Friday
's
action
``
was
an
old-fashioned
panic
,
''
says
Alfred
Goldman
,
director
of
technical
market
analysis
for
A.G.
Edwards
&
Sons
in
St.
Louis
.

``
Stocks
were
being
thrown
out
of
windows
at
any
price
.
''

His
advice
:
``
You
ought
to
be
there
with
a
basket
catching
them
.
''

James
Craig
,
portfolio
manager
for
the
Denver-based
Janus
Fund
,
which
has
one
of
the
industry
's
better
track
records
,
started
his
buying
during
Friday
's
plunge
.

Stocks
such
as
Hershey
Foods
Corp.
,
Wal-Mart
Stores
Inc.
,
American
International
Group
Inc.
and
Federal
National
Mortgage
Association
became
such
bargains
that
he
could
n't
resist
them
,
he
says
.

And
Mr.
Craig
expects
to
pick
up
more
shares
today
.

``
It
will
be
chaotic
at
first
,
but
I
would
not
be
buying
if
I
thought
we
were
headed
for
real
trouble
,
''
he
says
.

He
argues
that
stocks
are
reasonably
valued
now
,
and
that
interest
rates
are
lower
now
than
in
the
fall
of
1987
.

Mr.
Front
of
Stein
Roe
suggests
that
any
buying
should
``
concentrate
in
stocks
that
have
lagged
the
market
on
the
up
side
,
or
stocks
that
have
been
beaten
down
a
lot
more
than
the
market
in
this
correction
.
''

His
firm
favors
selected
computer
,
drug
and
pollution-control
stocks
.

Other
investment
pros
are
more
pessimistic
.

They
say
investors
should
sell
stocks
--
but
not
necessarily
right
away
.

Many
of
them
stress
that
the
selling
can
be
orderly
,
gradual
,
and
done
when
stock
prices
are
rallying
.

On
Thursday
,
William
Fleckenstein
,
a
Seattle
money
manager
,
used
futures
contracts
in
his
personal
account
to
place
a
bet
that
the
broad
market
averages
would
decline
.

He
thinks
the
underlying
inflation
rate
is
around
5
%
to
6
%
,
far
higher
than
most
people
suppose
.

In
the
pension
accounts
he
manages
,
Mr.
Fleckenstein
has
raised
cash
positions
and
invested
in
gold
and
natural
gas
stocks
,
partly
as
an
inflation
hedge
.

He
thinks
government
officials
are
terrified
to
let
a
recession
start
when
government
,
corporate
and
personal
debt
levels
are
so
high
.

So
he
thinks
the
government
will
err
on
the
side
of
rekindled
inflation
.

As
a
result
,
Mr.
Fleckenstein
says
,
``
I
think
the
ball
game
's
over
,
''
and
investors
are
about
to
face
a
bear
market
.

David
M.
Jones
,
vice
president
at
Aubrey
G.
Lanston
&
Co.
,
recommends
Treasury
securities
(
of
up
to
five
years
'
maturity
)
.

He
says
the
Oct.
6
employment
report
,
showing
slower
economic
growth
and
a
severe
weakening
in
the
manufacturing
sector
,
is
a
warning
sign
to
investors
.

One
strategy
for
investors
who
want
to
stay
in
but
hedge
their
bets
is
to
buy
``
put
''
options
,
either
on
the
individual
stocks
they
own
or
on
a
broad
market
index
.

A
put
option
gives
its
holder
the
right
(
but
not
the
obligation
)
to
sell
a
stock
(
or
stock
index
)
for
a
specified
price
(
the
strike
price
)
until
the
option
expires
.

Whether
this
insurance
is
worthwhile
depends
on
the
cost
of
an
option
.

The
cost
,
or
premium
,
tends
to
get
fat
in
times
of
crisis
.

Thus
,
buying
puts
after
a
big
market
slide
can
be
an
expensive
way
to
hedge
against
risk
.

The
prices
of
puts
generally
did
n't
soar
Friday
.

For
example
,
the
premium
as
a
percentage
of
the
stock
price
for
certain
puts
on
Eli
Lilly
&
Co.
moved
up
from
3
%
at
Thursday
's
close
to
only
3.3
%
at
Friday
's
close
,
even
though
the
shares
dropped
more
than
$
5.50
.

But
put-option
prices
may
zoom
when
trading
resumes
today
.

It
's
hard
to
generalize
about
a
reasonable
price
for
puts
.

But
investors
should
keep
in
mind
,
before
paying
too
much
,
that
the
average
annual
return
for
stock
holdings
,
long-term
,
is
9
%
to
10
%
a
year
;
a
return
of
15
%
is
considered
praiseworthy
.

Paying
,
say
,
10
%
for
insurance
against
losses
takes
a
deep
bite
out
of
the
return
.

Coldwell
Banker
Commercial
Group
said
it
sold
$
47
million
of
common
stock
to
its
employees
at
$
10
a
share
,
giving
them
a
total
stake
of
more
than
40
%
in
the
commercial
real
estate
brokerage
firm
.

The
firm
,
which
was
acquired
in
April
from
Sears
,
Roebuck
&
Co.
in
a
management-led
buy-out
,
had
planned
to
sell
up
to
$
56.4
million
of
stock
,
or
a
50
%
stake
in
the
company
,
to
its
5,000
employees
.

Though
the
offering
did
n't
sell
out
,
James
J.
Didion
,
chairman
and
chief
executive
officer
,
said
,
``
We
're
pretty
proud
of
the
employees

response
.
''

He
noted
that
unlike
an
employee
stock
ownership
plan
,
where
a
company
usually
borrows
money
from
third
party
lenders
to
buy
stock
that
it
sets
aside
to
award
employees
over
time
,
here
employees
had
to
fork
out
their
own
cash
for
the
stock
.

``
They
came
up
with
their
own
money
instead
of
borrowed
money
,
''
Mr.
Didion
said
.

``
It
's
totally
different
.
''

He
said
the
offering
was
designed
to
create
long-term
incentives
for
employees
.

``
We
're
in
a
service
business
,
and
in
that
context
,
it
's
vital
to
have
your
employees
involved
in
the
ownership
so
they
have
a
stake
in
the
success
.

The
brokerage
firm
wo
n't
pay
a
dividend
on
the
stock
.

Employees
have
the
right
to
trade
stock
among
themselves
,
and
the
company
will
establish
an
internal
clearing
house
for
these
transactions
.

They
may
also
eventually
sell
the

to
third

Coldwell

also
named

The
first
major
event
this
morning
in
U.S.
stock
and
futures
trading
may
be
a
pause
at
the
Chicago
Mercantile
Exchange
.

Under
a
reform
arising
from
the
1987
crash
,
trading
in
the
Merc
's
stock-index
futures
will
break
for
10
minutes
if
the
contract
opens
and
stays
five
points
from
Friday
's
close
,
a
move
equal
to
40
points
on
the
Dow
Jones
Industrial
Average
.

The
aim
of
the
interruption
would
be
to
ease
the
opening
of
the
New
York
Stock
Exchange
,
which
would
be
hammered
by
such
a
volatile
move
on
the
Merc
.

That
early-morning
breather
is
just
one
of
a
number
of
safeguards
adopted
after
the
1987
crash
.

The
Big
Board
also
added
computer
capacity
to
handle
huge
surges
in
trading
volume
.

Several
of
those
post-crash
changes
kicked
in
during
Friday
's
one-hour
collapse
and
worked
as
expected
,
even
though
they
did
n't
prevent
a
stunning
plunge
.

But
the
major
``
circuit
breakers
''
have
yet
to
be
evaluated
.

A
deeper
market
plunge
today
could
give
them
their
first
test
.

A
further
slide
also
would
resurrect
debate
over
a
host
of
other
,
more
sweeping
changes
proposed
--
but
not
implemented
--
after
the
last
crash
.

Most
notably
,
several
of
the
regulatory
steps
recommended
by
the
Brady
Task
Force
,
which
analyzed
the
1987
crash
,
would
be
revived
--
especially
because
that
group
's
chairman
is
now
the
Treasury
secretary
.

The
most
controversial
of
the
Brady
recommendations
involved
establishing
a
single
overarching
regulator
to
handle
crucial
cross-market
questions
,
such
as
setting
consistent
margin
requirements
for
the
stock
and
futures
markets
.

But
for
the
moment
,
attention
focuses
on
the
reforms
that
were
put
into
place
,
and
market
regulators
and
participants
said
the
circuit
breakers
worked
as
intended
.

Big
Board
and
Merc
officials
expressed
satisfaction
with
the
results
of
two
limits
imposed
on
of
the
Merc
's
Standard
&
Poor
's
500
contract
,
as
well
as
``
hot-line
''
communications
among
exchanges
.

Those
pauses
--
from
2:07
p.m.
to
2:30
p.m.
CDT
and
from
2:45
p.m.
until
the
close
of
trading
a
half-hour
later
--
forced
traders
to
buy
and
sell
contracts
at
prices
at
or
higher
than
their
frozen
levels
.

During
the
first
halt
,
after
the
S&P
index
had
fallen
12
points
,
the
Big
Board
's
``
Sidecar
''
computer
program
automatically
was
triggered
.

That
system
is
designed
to
separate
computer-generated
program
trades
from
all
other
trades
to
help
exchange
officials
resolve
order
imbalances
in
individual
stocks
.

One
Merc
broker
compared
the
action
in
the
S&P
pit
during
the
two
freezes
to
a
fire
at
a
well-drilled
school
.

``
You
do
n't
want
the
fire
but
you
know
what
to
do
,
''
said
Howard
Dubnow
,
an
independent
floor
broker
and
a
Merc
governor
.

``
There
was
no
panic
.

The
system
worked
the
way
we
devised
it
to
work
.
''

After
reopening
for
about
15
minutes
,
the
S&P
index
tumbled
to
its
30-point
limit
and
the
second
freeze
went
into
effect
.

Traders
then
spent
the
last
half-hour
``
watching
to
see
if
the
Dow
would
drop
250
points
,
''
Mr.
Dubnow
added
,
referring
to
the
level
at
which
the
stock
market
itself
would
have
closed
for
an
hour
.

One
observer
estimated
that
80
%
to
90
%
of
the
S&P
traders
``
were
just
standing
around
watching
.
''

But
the
250-point
circuit
breaker
never
had
to
kick
in
,
and
freezes
on
the
Chicago
Board
of
Trade
's
Major
Market
Index
also
were
n't
triggered
.

The
MMI
and
the
S&P
500
are
the
two
major
indexes
used
by
program
traders
to
run
their
computerized
trading
strategies
.

The
programs
are
considered
by
many
to
be
a
major
cause
of
the
1987
crash
.

The
process
of
post-crash
reforms
began
with
calls
to
remake
the
markets
and
wound
up
a
year
later
with
a
series
of
rather
technical
adjustments
.

In
October
1987
,
just
after
the
market
drop
,
Washington
was
awash
in
talk
of
sweeping
changes
in
the
way
the
financial
markets
are
structured
and
regulated
.

Over
the
next
year
that
grand
agenda
was
whittled
down
to
a
series
of
steps
to
soften
big
stock
drops
by
interrupting
trading
to
give
market
players
time
to
pause
and
reconsider
positions
.

In
addition
,
limits
were
placed
on
computer-driven
trading
,
and
steps
were
taken
to
better
link
the
stock
and
futures
markets
.

Few
changes
were
made
in
the
way
the
markets
are
regulated
.

At
the
outset
the
prime
target
was
program
trading
,
which
was
much
discussed
but
little
understood
on
Capitol
Hill
.

There
were
also
calls
to
strip
the
stock
markets
of
``
derivative
''
products
,
such
as
stock-index
futures
and
options
,
which
Federal
Judge
Stanley
Sporkin
,
for
example
,
likened
to
``
barnacles
attached
to
the
basic
market
.
''

And
there
was
much
criticism
of
the
New
York
Stock
Exchange
's
system
of
having
stock
trades
flow
through
specialists
,
or
market
makers
.

When
the
Brady
Task
Force
's
powerful
analysis
of
the
crash
was
released
in
January
1988
,
it
immediately
reshaped
the
reformers
'
agenda
.

Arguing
that
the
separate
financial
marketplaces
acted
as
one
,
and
concluding
that
the
crash
had
``
raised
the
possibility
of
a
full-scale
financial
system
breakdown
,
''
the
presidential
task
force
called
for
establishing
a
super-regulator
to
oversee
the
markets
,
to
make
margins
consistent
across
markets
,
to
unify
clearing
systems
and
to
install
circuit
breakers
.

Only
the
last
of
those
recommendations
ever
was
implemented
.

The
Reagan
White
House
held
the
Brady
recommendations
at
arm
's
length
and
named
a
second
panel
--
the
Working
Group
on
the
Financial
Markets
--
to
review
its
analysis
and
those
of
other
crash
studies
.

In
May
1988
,
the
Working
Group
,
made
up
of
representatives
from
the
Federal
Reserve
,
the
Treasury
,
the
Securities
and
Exchange
Commission
,
and
the
Commodity
Futures
Trading
Commission
,
finally
endorsed
only
circuit
breakers
.

After
several
more
months
of
arguments
among
various
stock
exchanges
and
futures
markets
,
circuit
breakers
were
set
in
place
,
with
the
most
notable
suspending
trading
after
250
and
400
point
drops
in
the
Dow
Jones
Industrial
Average
.

Privately
,
some
free
marketeers
dismissed
such
mechanisms
as
sops
to
interventionists
.

After
all
,
this
free-market
argument
went
,
the
Dow
only
dropped
more
than
250
points
once
this
century
.

``
Circuit
breakers
''
set
to
soften
big
drops
:

--
If
S&P
futures
fall
5
points
at
opening
,
contract
trading
pauses
for
10
minutes
.

--
If
Dow
Industrials
fall
25
points
at
opening
,
contract
trading
pauses
for
10
minutes
.

--
If
S&P
futures
fall
12
points
(
equivalent
to
about
100
points
on
DJIA
)
,
trading
is
frozen
for
half
hour
to
that
price
or
higher
.

On
NYSE
program
trades
are
diverted
into
a
separate
computer
file
to
determine
buy
and
sell
orders
.

--
If
S&P
futures
fall
30
points
,
trading
is
restricted
for
an
hour
to
that
price
or
higher
.

--
If
Dow
Industrials
fall
250
points
,
trading
on
the
Big
Board
halts
for
an
hour
.

S&P
and
MMI
contracts
also
halt
.

--
If
DJIA
drops
400
points
,
Big
Board
halts
trading
for
two
hours
.

Trading
in
MMI
and
S&P
futures
also
halted
.

Brady
Task
Force
recommendations
(
Jan.
1988
)
:

--
Establish
an
overarching
regulator
for
financial
markets

--
Unify
trade-clearing
systems

--
Make
margins
consistent
across
stock
and
futures
markets

SEC
proposals
(
May
1988
)
:

--
Require
prompt
reports
of
large
securities
trades
.

--
Give
SEC
authority
to
monitor
risk-taking
by
affiliates
of
brokerage
firms
.

--
Transfer
jurisdiction
over
stock-related
futures
to
SEC
from
CFTC
.

(
Opposed
by
new
SEC
chairman
)

--
Give
SEC
authority
to
halt
securities
trading
,
(
also
opposed
by
new
SEC
chairman
)
.

Congressional
proposal
:

--
Create
a
task
force
to
review
current
state
of
the
securities
markets
and
securities
laws
.

Breaking
the
Soviet
government
's
television
monopoly
,
an
independent
company
has
gained
rights
to
show
world
programming
,
including
American
films
.

``
There
must
not
be
a
monopoly
,
there
must
be
freedom
of
choice
for
both
journalists
and
viewers
,
''
Nikolai
I.
Lutsenko
,
the
president
of
the
Nika
TV
company
,
told
the
weekly
newspaper
Nedelya
.

The
company
is
already
working
on
its
own
programming
in
several
provincial
cities
and
hopes
to
be
on
the
air
regularly
in
about
a
year
,
the
newspaper
said
.

Mr.
Lutsenko
told
Nedelya
that
he
recently
had
been
to
the
U.S.
to
pick
up
the
rights
to
show
5,000
U.S.
films
in
the
Soviet
Union
.

Nedelya
's
article
was
accompanied
by
a
picture
of
Mr.
Lutsenko
interviewing
singer
John
Denver
in
Colorado
.

Even
though
it
will
be
independent
of
official
television
,
Nika
will
have
an
oversight
board
that
will
include
members
of
the
Communist
youth
league
.

South
Africa
's
National
Union
of
Mineworkers
said
that
about
10,000
diamond
miners
struck
for
higher
wages
at
De
Beers
Consolidated
Mines
Ltd.

De
Beers
said
that
workers
at
five
of
the
group
's
mines
were
on
strike
,
which
it
said
was
peaceful
,
with
orderly
picketing
occurring
at
one
of
the
mines
.

The
deadlock
in
negotiations
occurred
with
De
Beers
offering
a
17
%
increase
in
the
minimum-wage
category
while
the
union
demanded
a
37.6
%
increase
in
the
minimum
wage
.

Japan
's
opposition
Socialist
Party
denied
that
its
legislators
had
been
bribed
by
pinball-parlor
owners
.

The
allegation
had
been
raised
in
Parliament
by
the
governing
Liberal
Democratic
Party
following
magazine
reports
suggesting
that
money
from
Japanese-style
pinball
,
called
pachinko
,
had
infiltrated
politics
.

Tsuruo
Yamaguchi
,
secretary
general
of
the
Socialist
Party
,
acknowledged
that
nine
party
lawmakers
had
received
donations
from
the
pachinko
association
totaling
8
million
yen
(
about
$
55,000
)
but
said
the
donations
were
legal
and
none
of
its
members
acted
to
favor
the
industry
.

The
World
Wide
Fund
for
Nature
said
that
Spain
,
Argentina
,
Thailand
and
Indonesia
were
doing
too
little
to
prevent
illegal
trade
in
endangered
wildlife
across
their
borders
.

A
report
by
the
conservation
group
presented
at
the
U.N.-sponsored
Convention
on
International
Trade
in
Endangered
Species
in
Lausanne
accused
the
four
of
trading
protected
species
ranging
from
parakeets
to
orchids
.

Fund
official
Simon
Lyster
said
world
trade
in
wildlife
was
estimated
to
total
$
5
billion
of
business
annually
.

A
NATO
project
to
build
a
frigate
for
the
1990s
was
torpedoed
by
the
pull-out
of
three
of
its
eight
participating
nations
.

Britain
,
France
and
Italy
announced
technical
reasons
for
withdrawing
,
but
some
officials
pointed
to
growing
reluctance
among
the
allies
to
commit
themselves
to
big
defense
spending
while
East-West
disarmament
talks
show
signs
of
success
.

Small
wonder
that
Britain
's
Labor
Party
wants
credit
controls
.

A
few
hours
after
the
party
launched
its
own
affinity
credit
card
earlier
this
month
,
the
Tories
raised
the
nation
's
base
interest
rate
.

Labor
's
Visa
card
is
believed
to
be
the
first
linked
to
a
British
political
party
.

Labor
gets
25
pence
(
39
cents
)
for
every
100
(
about
$
155
)
that
a
user
charges
to
the
card
.

As
with
other
plastic
in
Britain
's
high-interest-rate
environment
,
the
Labor
card
,
administered
by
Co-operative
Bank
,
carries
a
stiff
(
in
this
case
,
29.8
%
)
annual
rate
on
the
unpaid
balance
.

China
's
year-long
austerity
program
has
achieved
some
successes
in
harnessing
runaway
economic
growth
and
stabilizing
prices
but
has
failed
to
eliminate
serious
defects
in
state
planning
and
an
alarming
drain
on
state
budgets
.

The
official
China
Daily
said
retail
prices
of
non-staple
foods
have
n't
risen
since
last
December
but
acknowledged
that
huge
government
subsidies
were
a
main
factor
in
keeping
prices
down
.

The
State
Statistical
Bureau
found
that
more
than
1
billion
yuan
(
$
270
million
)
was
spent
in
the
first
half
of
the
year
for
pork
subsidies
.

The
newspaper
quoted
experts
as
saying
the
subsidies
would
cause
the
difference
between
prices
and
real
values
of
commodities
to
``
become
very
unreasonable
''
and
reduce
needed
funds
for
investment
in
the
``
already
difficult
state
budget
.
''

The
aim
of
the
austerity
measures
was
to
slice
economic
growth
,
which
soared
to
20.7
%
last
year
,
to
8
%
in
1990
.

Economists
now
predict
the
growth
rate
will
be
about
11.5
%
for
the
year
.

In
a
sign
of
growing
official
tolerance
for
religion
,
Russian
Orthodox
priests
were
allowed
to
celebrate
the
400th
anniversary
of
the
Moscow
patriarchate
in
the
Kremlin
's
15th-century
Uspensky
Cathedral
,
where
czars
were
crowned
...
.

A
34-foot-tall
,
$
7.7
million
statue
of
Buddha
was
completed
on
a
hill
outside
Hong
Kong
,
facing
China
.

The
statue
is
the
brainchild
of
Sik
Chi
Wan
,
director
of
the
Po
Lin
Monastery
,
who
said
:
``
Hong
Kong
is
such
a
prosperous
place
,
we
also
need
some
kind
of
religious
symbol
.

It
all
seemed
innocent
enough
:
Last
April
,
one
Steven
B.
Iken
visited
Justin
Products
Inc.
here
,
identified
himself
as
a
potential
customer
and
got
the
word
on
the
little
company
's
new
cassette
players
for
children
.

``
It
is
almost
identical
to
the
Sony
product
,
''
Mr.
Iken
remarked
,
after
seeing
prototypes
and
pictures
.

Replied
a
Justin
salesman
:
``
Exactly
.
''

The
Justin
merchandise
carried
wholesale
prices
some
40
%
below
those
of
Sony
Corp.
of
Japan
's
``
My
First
Sony
''
line
.

The
visitor
waxed
enthusiastic
and
promised
to
return
.

But
instead
of
a
new
customer
--
part
of
a
hoped-for
bonanza
from
underselling
Sony
--
Justin
got
a
costly
legal
morass
.

Mr.
Iken
,
it
turned
out
,
was
a
private
detective
using
a
hidden
tape
recorder
to
gather
information
for
Sony
.

His
recording
later
turned
up
as
a
court
exhibit
.

Seeking
to
keep
Justin
's
``
My
Own
''
product
line
off
the
U.S.
market
,
Sony
last
May
filed
a
suit
in
Manhattan
federal
court
accusing
the
upstart
of
trademark
infringement
,
unfair
competition
and
other
violations
of
business
law
.

Since
then
,
life
has
changed
a
lot
for
61-year-old
Leonard
Kaye
,
Justin
's
owner
.

``
I
have
n't
been
able
to
get
a
decent
night
's
sleep
since
this
has
been
going
on
,
''
he
says
.

``
It
's
the
most
distracting
thing
in
my
life
--
I
ca
n't
even
attend
to
my
business
.
''

His
company
(
annual
sales
:
about
$
25
million
)
may
suffer
a
costly
blow
--
losing
an
estimated
10
%
of
total
sales
--
if
Sony
(
annual
sales
:
about
$
16
billion
)
prevails
.

Justin
's
plight
shows
what
can
happen
when
a
tiny
company
suddenly
faces
the
full
legal
might
of
a
wrathful
multinational
.

With
considerable
irony
,
the
case
also
shows
how
completely
Japan
has
turned
the
tables
on
U.S.
business
.

Americans
used
to
complain
bitterly
about
being
undersold
by
look-alike
products
from
Japan
.

Now
Sony
,
whose
innovative
,
premium-priced
products
are
among
the
most
admired
in
consumer
electronics
,
is
bitterly
complaining
about
a
little
U.S.
firm
with
a
cheap
look-alike
produced
in
China
.

``
The
gist
of
this
is
that
Justin
knocked
off
the
Sony
line
and
Sony
wants
to
stop
it
,
''
says
Lewis
H.
Eslinger
,
Sony
's
attorney
,
who
previously
guarded
Rubik
's
Cube
.

(
Sony
itself
declines
to
comment
.
)

If
Sony
wins
,
Mr.
Eslinger
says
,
its
little
rival
will
have
to
try
to
sell
the
products
overseas
.

At
worst
,
he
adds
,
``
They
'd
have
to
grind
them
all
up
and
throw
them
away
.
''

Mr.
Kaye
denies
the
suit
's
charges
and
says
his
only
mistake
was
taking
on
Sony
in
the
marketplace
.

``
I
made
a
similar
line
and
I
produced
it
cheaper
,
''
he
says
.

Today
,
U.S.
Judge
John
E.
Sprizzo
is
expected
to
rule
on
Sony
's
renewed
request
for
a
pre-trial
order
blocking
sale
of
the
disputed
products
,
on
which
deliveries
began
in
July
.

The
judge
turned
down
an
earlier
Sony
request
for
such
an
order
--
a
decision
upheld
on
appeal
--
but
Sony
returned
with
additional
evidence
and
arguments
.

Though
hoping
to
settle
the
case
,
Justin
vows
to
fight
on
,
if
necessary
.

But
the
battle
is
more
than
Justin
bargained
for
.

``
I
had
no
idea
I
was
getting
in
so
deep
,
''
says
Mr.
Kaye
,
who
founded
Justin
in
1982
.

Mr.
Kaye
had
sold
Capetronic
Inc.
,
a
Taiwan
electronics
maker
,
and
retired
,
only
to
find
he
was
bored
.

With
Justin
,
he
began
selling
toys
and
electronics
made
mostly
in
Hong
Kong
,
beginning
with
Mickey
Mouse
radios
.

The
company
has
grown
--
to
about
40
employees
,
from
four
initially
,
Mr.
Kaye
says
.

Justin
has
been
profitable
since
1986
,
adds
the
official
,
who
shares
his
office
with
numerous
teddy
bears
,
all
samples
from
his
line
of
plush
toys
.

Like
many
others
,
Mr.
Kaye
took
notice
in
1987
when
Sony
,
in
a
classic
example
of
market
segmentation
,
changed
the
plastic
skin
and
buttons
on
the
famous
Walkman
line
of
portable
audio
equipment
and
created
the
My
First
Sony
line
for
children
.

The
brightly
colored
new
products
looked
more
like
toys
than
the
adult
models
.

(
In
court
papers
,
Sony
says
it
has
spent
more
than
$
3
million
to
promote
the
line
,
with
resulting
sales
of
over
a
million
units
.
)

Sony
found
a
new
market
niche
,
but
Mr.
Kaye
figured
that
its
prices
left
plenty
of
room
for
a
lower-priced
competitor
.

His
products
are
n't
exact
copies
of
Sony
's
but
strongly
resemble
them
in
size
,
shape
and
,
especially
,
color
.

Sony
uses
mostly
red
and
blue
,
with
traces
of
yellow
--
and
so
does
Justin
,
on
the
theory
that
kids
prefer
these
colors
.

(
``
To
be
successful
,
a
product
can
be
any
color
whatsoever
,
as
long
as
it
is
fire-engine
red
,
''
says
Charles
E.
Baxley
,
Justin
's
attorney
.
)

By
last
winter
,
Justin
was
showing
prototypes
at
toy
fairs
in
Hong
Kong
and
New
York
--
and
Sony
noticed
.

Indeed
,
concerned
that
Sony
sales
personnel
were
threatening
legal
action
or
other
retaliation
--
such
as
withholding
desirable
Sony
products
--
against
Justin
's
customers
,
Mr.
Baxley
fired
off
a
letter
to
Sony
in
April
.

He
himself
threatened
to
take
the
matter
to
the
Federal
Trade
Commission
or
U.S.
Justice
Department
.

But
Justin
has
n't
pursued
those
charges
(
which
were
without
merit
,
according
to
Mr.
Eslinger
,
the
Sony
attorney
)
.

Recalls
Mr.
Baxley
:
``
Our
purpose
was
to
influence
them
to
leave
us
alone
.

We
never
intended
taking
on
Sony
--
we
do
n't
have
the
resources
.
''

Sony
answered
the
empty
threat
with
its
real
suit
.

Off
and
on
since
then
,
the
companies
have
skirmished
in
court
.

And
Justin
,
in
a
news
release
,
says
,
``
Once
competitive
,
Sony
now
resorts
to
strong-arm
tactics
in
American
courtrooms
to
carve
out
and
protect
niche
markets
.
''

Sony
's
lawyer
insists
that
the
company
's
tactics
--
including
the
use
of
a
private
detective
posing
as
a
buyer
--
are
routine
in
such
matters
.

He
also
insists
that
Sony
,
no
less
than
others
,
has
a
legal
right
to
protect
its
``
trade
dress
,
''
in
this
case
,
mostly
the
colors
that
it
claims
make
My
First
Sony
products
distinctive
.

(
Justin
claims
it
began
using
the
same
colors
on
electronic
goods
for
children
long
before
Sony
entered
the
children
's
market
.
)

Whatever
its
merits
,
Sony
's
aggressive
defense
is
debilitating
for
Justin
.

It
's
also
costly
.

Mr.
Kaye
says
he
has
paid
more
than
$
70,000
in
legal
fees
so
far
.

Of
Sony
,
Mr.
Kaye
says
:
``
They
know
there
's
no
way
for
them
to
lose
.

They
just
keep
digging
me
in
deeper
until
I
reach
the
point
where
I
give
up
and
go
away
.
''

For
now
,
though
,
he
vows
to
hang
in
.

@
Charles
H.
Tenney

Unitil
Corp.
,
purchased
34,602

,
or
4.9
%
,
of
Unitil
's
common
,
according
to
a
filing
with
the
Securities

Commission
.

The
stock
was
bought
on
Thursday
in

Both

Investcorp
,
New

,
said
it
and
the

a
director
of
the

.

Sports

The
company
is
``
very
profitable
''
on
an
operating
basis
,
Mr.
Richardson
said
,
but
he
declined
to
specify
numbers
.

In
1982
,
Sports
&
Recreation
's
managers
and
certain
passive
investors
purchased
the
company
from
Brunswick
Corp.
of
Skokie

In
the
latest
transaction
,

bought
out

Hammond
Co.
,
Newport

,
Calif.
,
said
Fidelity
National
Financial
Inc.
extended
its
previous
agreement
,
under
which
it
wo
n't
purchase
any
more
of
the
mortgage
banker
's
common
stock
,
through
Oct.
31
.

The
previous
agreement
expired
Thursday
.

Hammond
said
that
its
discussions
with
Fidelity
,
an
Irvine
,
Calif.
,
title-insurance
underwriter
,
are
continuing
,
but
that
prospects
for
a
longer-term
standstill
agreement
are
uncertain
.

Fidelity
has
increased
its
stake
in
Hammond
to
23.57
%
in
recent
months
.

Statements
made
in
Securities
and
Exchange
Commission
filings
led
Hammond
to
request
a
standstill
agreement
.

Giant
Group
Ltd.
said
it
terminated
negotiations
for
the
purchase
of
Aspen
Airways
,
a
Denver-based
regional
carrier
that
operates
the
United
Express
connector
service
under
contract
to
UAL
Corp.
's
United
Airlines
.

Giant
,
a
Beverly
Hills
,
Calif.
,
collection
of
companies
that
is
controlled
by
Hollywood
producer
Burt
Sugarman
,
did
n't
give
a
reason
for
halting
its
plan
to
acquire
the
airline
,
and
Aspen
officials
could
n't
be
reached
for
comment
.

Giant
agreed
last
month
to
purchase
the
carrier
.

Giant
has
n't
ever
disclosed
the
proposed
price
,
although
Avmark
Inc.
,
an
Arlington
,
Va.-based
aircraft
consulting
concern
,
has
valued
Aspen
's
fleet
at
about
$
46
million
.

The
airline
would
have
become
the
latest
in
a
peculiar
blend
of
Giant
companies
,
which
are
involved
in
making
cement
,
recycling
newsprint
and
operating
fast-food
restaurants
.

The
state-controlled
insurer
Assurances
Generales
de
France
said
it
has
obtained
regulatory
approval
to
increase
its
stake
in
the
financial
holding
company
Cie.
de
Navigation
Mixte
above
10
%
from
the
current
level
of
about
8
%
.

Friday
's
approval
was
needed
to
conform
with
Bourse
rules
regarding
companies
with
bank
interests
and
follows
a
similar
approval
given
Wednesday
to
Cie
.
Financiere
de
Paribas
.

Both
Paribas
and
AGF
have
been
increasing
their
stakes
in
Navigation
Mixte
recently
for
what
they
have
termed
``
investment
purposes
,
''
although
the
issue
has
been
surrounded
by
takeover
speculation
in
recent
weeks
.

AGF
did
n't
comment
officially
on
its
reasons
for
seeking
the
approval
,
but
people
close
to
the
group
said
it
was
done
to
make
sure
the
group
would
have
the
flexibility
to
increase
its
stake
in
the
future
,
should
interesting
price
opportunities
arise
.

An
AGF
official
did
specify
,
however
,
that
there
was
no
foundation
to
recent
rumors
the
group
might
be
acting
in
concert
with
Paribas
.

Lockheed
Aeronautical
Systems
Co.
,
a
unit
of
Lockheed
Corp.
,
said
it
agreed
to
join
with
Aermacchi
S.p
.
A.
of
Varese
,
Italy
,
to
propose
a
new
generation
of
jet
trainers
for
the
U.S.
Air
Force
.

The
Air
Force
is
looking
to
buy
540
new
primary
jet
trainers
,
with
a
total
value
of
$
1.5
billion
to
$
2
billion
,
between
1994
and
2004
.

The
aircraft
would
replace
the
T-37
,
made
by
the
Cessna
Aircraft
Co.
unit
of
General
Dynamics
Corp.
,
which
the
Air
Force
uses
to
train
jet
pilots
.

Lockheed
said
the
U.S.
Navy
may
also
buy
an
additional
340
trainer
aircraft
to
replace
its
T34C
trainers
made
by
the
Beech
Aircraft
Corp.
unit
of
Raytheon
Corp
.

Under
the
agreement
with
Lockheed
,
Aermacchi
will
license
Lockheed
to
build
the
Aermacchi
MB-339
jet
tandem-trainer
and
will
supply
certain
structures
.

Lockheed
will
build
additional
structures
and
perform
final
assembly
of
the
tandem-seat
trainer
at
its
Marietta
,
Ga.
,
plant
should
the
Air
Force
order
the
craft
.

A
Lockheed
spokesman
in
Burbank
,
Calif.
,
said
he
was
n't
aware
of
which
other
companies
would
be
competing
for
the
Air
Force
contract
.

Striking
auto
workers
ended
their
19-day
occupation
of
a
metal
shop
at
a
Peugeot
S.A.
factory
in
eastern
France
Friday
as
pay
talks
got
under
way
in
the
capital
.

But
the
Peugeot
breakthrough
came
as
a
nationwide
dispute
by
Finance
Ministry
employees
disrupted
border
checkpoints
and
threatened
the
government
's
ability
to
pay
its
bills
.

The
Peugeot
metalworkers
began
filing
out
of
the
shop
,
which
makes
auto
parts
,
at
the
plant
in
Mulhouse
after
voting
589
to
193
to
abandon
the
occupation
.

Their
withdrawal
was
based
on
promises
by
Peugeot
to
open
negotiations
in
Paris
at
the
same
time
the
last
man
left
the
premises
.

The
strike
by
customs
officers
,
tax
collectors
,
treasury
workers
and
other
civil
servants
attached
to
the
Ministry
of
Finance
may
pose
a
more
serious
challenge
to
the
government
and
the
average
Frenchman
.

Ministry
employees
complain
that
they
are
poorly
paid
because
of
a
complex
job-rating
system
they
say
fails
to
take
into
account
their
education
and
level
of
technical
expertise
.

The
market
for
$
200
billion
of
high-risk
junk
bonds
,
battered
by
a
succession
of
defaults
and
huge
price
declines
this
year
,
practically
vanished
Friday
.

Trading
ground
to
a
halt
as
investors
rushed
to
sell
bonds
,
only
to
find
themselves
deserted
by
potential
buyers
.

Stunned
,
they
watched
brokerage
houses
mark
down
price
quotations
on
their
junk
holdings
while
being
able
to
execute
very
few
actual
trades
.

``
The
junk
bond
market
is
in
a
state
of
gridlock
now
--
there
are
no
bids
,
only
offers
,
''
says
independent
investor
Martin
D.
Sass
,
who
manages
nearly
$
4
billion
and
who
recently
decided
to
buy
distressed
securities
for
a
new
fund
.

This
calamity
is
``
far
from
over
,
''
he
says
.

Junk
's
collapse
helped
stoke
the
panicky
selling
of
stocks
that
produced
the
deepest
one-day
dive
in
the
Dow
Jones
Industrial
Average
since
the
Oct.
19
,
1987
,
crash
.

Simultaneously
,
it
also
helped
trigger
this
year
's
biggest
rally
in
the
U.S.
government
bond
market
as
investors
rushed
to
move
capital
into
the
highest-quality
securities
they
could
find
.

But
``
an
eerie
silence
pervaded
''
the
junk
market
Friday
as
prices
tumbled
on
hundreds
of
high-yield
bonds
despite
``
no
active
trading
,
''
says
John
Lonski
,
an
economist
at
Moody
's
Investors
Service
Inc
.

For
example
,
the
price
of
Southland
Corp.
's
$
500
million
of
16
3\/4
%
bonds
due
2002
--
sold
less
than
two
years
ago
by
Goldman
,
Sachs
&
Co.
--
plummeted
25
%
to
just
30
cents
on
the
dollar
.

But
not
even
Goldman
would
make
a
market
in
the
securities
of
Southland
,
the
owner
of
the
nationwide
chain
of
7-11
convenience
stores
that
is
strapped
for
cash
.

Goldman
officials
declined
to
comment
.

Junk
bonds
,
which
mushroomed
from
less
than
$
2
billion
at
the
start
of
this
decade
,
have
been
declining
for
months
as
issuer
after
issuer
sank
beneath
the
weight
of
hefty
interest
payments
.

The
shaky
market
received
its
biggest
jolt
last
month
from
Campeau
Corp.
,
which
created
its
U.S.
retailing
empire
with
junk
financing
.

Campeau
developed
a
cash
squeeze
that
caused
it
to
be
tardy
on
some
interest
payments
and
to
put
its
prestigious
Bloomingdales
department-store
chain
up
for
sale
.

Now
,
dozens
of
corporations
,
including
Ethan
Allen
,
TW
Services
and
York
International
,
that
are
counting
on
at
least
$
7
billion
of
scheduled
new
junk
financings
to
keep
their
highly
leveraged
takeovers
and
buy-outs
afloat
,
may
never
get
the
money
.

``
The
music
has
stopped
playing
,
''
says
Michael
Harkins
,
a
principal
in
the
investment
firm
of
Levy
Harkins
.

``
You
've
either
got
a
chair
or
you
do
n't
.
''

In
Friday
's
aftermath
,
says
R.
Douglas
Carleton
,
a
director
of
high-yield
finance
at
First
Boston
Corp.
,
``
much
of
the
$
7
billion
forward
calendar
could
be
deferred
,
depending
on
the
hysteria
.
''

In
August
,
First
Boston
withdrew
a
$
475
million
junk
offering
of
Ohio
Mattress
bonds
because
potential
buyers
were
``
very
skittish
.
''

The
outlook
``
looks
shaky
because
we
're
still
waiting
''
for
mutual
funds
,
in
particular
,
to
dump
some
of
their
junk
bond
holdings
to
pay
off
redemptions
by
individual
investors
,
says
King
Penniman
,
senior
vice
president
at
McCarthy
,
Crisanti
&
Maffei
,
an
investment
arm
of
Xerox
Financial
Services
.

Indeed
,
a
Moody
's
index
that
tracks
the
net
asset
values
of
24
high-yield
mutual
funds
declined
for
the
17th
consecutive
day
Friday
.

In
a
stark
contrast
,
the
benchmark
30-year
Treasury
bond
climbed
more
than
2
1\/2
points
,
or
about
$
25
for
each
$
1,000
face
amount
,
to
103
12\/32
,
its
biggest
gain
of
the
year
.

The
bond
's
yield
dropped
to
7.82
%
,
the
lowest
since
March
31
,
1987
,
according
to
Technical
Data
Global
Markets
Group
.

The
yield
on
three-month
Treasury
bills
,
considered
the
safest
of
all
investments
,
plummeted
about
0.7
percentage
point
to
7.16
%
,
the
largest
one-day
decline
since
1982
.

The
main
catalyst
for
government
bond
market
rally
was
the
190.58-point
drop
in
the
Dow
Jones
Industrial
Average
.

``
When
you
get
panic
in
one
market
,
you
get
flight
to
quality
in
the
other
,
''
said
Maria
Ramirez
,
money
market
economist
at
Drexel
Burnham
Lambert
Inc
.

Nevertheless
,
the
problems
of
the
junk
market
could
prompt
the
Federal
Reserve
to
ease
credit
in
the
months
ahead
.

``
This
marks
a
significant
shift
in
the
interest
rate
outlook
,
''
says
William
Sullivan
,
director
of
money
market
research
at
Dean
Witter
Reynolds
Inc.
,
New
York
.

Any
sustained
credit-easing
could
be
a
lift
for
junk
bonds
as
well
as
other
securities
.

Robert
Dow
,
a
partner
and
portfolio
manager
at
Lord
,
Abbett
&
Co.
,
which
manages
$
4
billion
of
high-yield
bonds
,
says
he
does
n't
``
think
there
is
any
fundamental
economic
rationale
{
for
the
junk
bond
rout
}
.

It
was
herd
instinct
.
''

He
adds
:
``
The
junk
market
has
witnessed
some
trouble
and
now
some
people
think
that
if
the
equity
market
gets
creamed
that
means
the
economy
will
be
terrible
and
that
's
bad
for
junk
.

I
do
n't
believe
that
's
the
case
,
but
I
believe
that
people
are
running
scared
.

There
is
a
flight
to
quality
,
and
the
quality
is
not
in
equities
and
not
in
junk
--
it
's
in
Treasurys
.
''

Even
as
trading
in
high-yield
issues
dried
up
over
the
past
month
,
corporations
sold
more
than
$
2
billion
of
new
junk
bonds
.

For
example
,
a
recent
$
375
million
offering
of
Petrolane
Gas
Services
L.P.
bonds
sold
by
First
Boston
was
three
times
oversubscribed
.

A
$
550
million
offering
of
Turner
Broadcasting
System
Inc
.
high-yield
securities
sold
last
week
by
Drexel
was
increased
$
50
million
because
of
strong
demand
.

First
Boston
estimates
that
in
November
and
December
alone
,
junk
bond
investors
will
receive
$
4.8
billion
of
coupon
interest
payments
.

``
That
's
a
clear
indication
that
there
is
and
will
be
an
undercurrent
of
basic
business
going
on
,
''
says
Mr.
Carleton
of
First
Boston
.

``
I
do
n't
know
how
people
can
say
the
junk
bond
market
disappeared
when
there
were
$
1.5
billion
of
orders
for
$
550
million
of
junk
bonds
sold
last
week
by
Turner
,
''
says
Raymond
Minella
,
co-head
of
merchant
banking
at
Merrill
Lynch
&
Co
.

``
When
the
rally
comes
,
insurance
companies
will
be
leading
it
because
they
have
billions
to
invest
and
invest
they
will
.

There
is
plenty
of
money
available
from
people
who
want
to
buy
well-structured
deals
;
it
's
the
stuff
that
's
financed
on
a
shoestring
that
people
are
wary
of
.
''

But
such
highly
leveraged
transactions
seemed
to
have
multiplied
this
year
,
casting
a
pall
over
much
of
the
junk
market
.

Michael
McNamara
,
director
of
fixed-income
research
at
Kemper
Financial
Services
,
says
the
quality
of
junk
issues
has
been
getting
poorer
,
contributing
to
the
slide
in
prices
.

``
Last
year
we
probably
bought
one
out
of
every
three
new
deals
,
''
he
says
.

``
This
year
,
at
best
,
it
's
in
one
in
every
five
or
six
.

And
our
credit
standards
have
n't
changed
one
iota
.
''

However
,
Mr.
McNamara
said
the
slide
in
junk
is
creating
``
one
hell
of
a
buying
opportunity
''
for
selective
buyers
.

For
the
moment
,
investors
seem
more
preoccupied
with
the
``
bad
''
junk
than
the
``
good
''
junk
.

``
The
market
has
been
weak
since
''
the
announcement
of
the
Campeau
cash
squeeze
and
the
company
's
subsequent
bailout
by
Olympia
&
York
,
says
Mr.
Minella
of
Merrill
Lynch
.

``
That
really
affected
the
market
in
that
people
started
to
ask
`
What
else
is
in
trouble
?
'
''

Well
before
Campeau
,
though
,
there
were
signs
that
the
junk
market
was
stumbling
through
one
of
its
worst
years
ever
.

Despite
the
relatively
strong
economy
,
junk
bond
prices
did
nothing
except
go
down
,
hammered
by
a
seemingly
endless
trail
of
bad
news
:

--
In
June
,
two
months
before
it
would
default
on
interest
payments
covering
some
of
its
$
1.2
billion
of
speculative
debt
securities
,
New
York-based
Integrated
Resources
Inc.
said
it
ran
out
of
borrowed
money
.

--
In
July
,
Southmark
Corp.
,
the
Dallas-based
real
estate
and
financial
services
company
with
about
$
1.3
billion
of
junk
bonds
,
voluntarily
filed
for
protection
under
U.S.
bankruptcy
law
.

--
By
the
end
of
July
,
the
difference
in
yield
between
an
index
of
junk
bonds
and
seven-year
Treasury
notes
widened
to
more
than
5.5
percentage
points
.

--
In
August
,
Resorts
International
Inc.
,
which
sold
more
than
$
500
million
of
junk
bonds
,
suspended
interest
payments
.

--
In
September
,
just
as
the
cash
squeeze
hit
Campeau
,
Lomas
Financial
Corp.
defaulted
on
$
145
million
of
notes
and
appeared
unlikely
to
pay
interest
on
a
total
of
$
1.2
billion
of
debt
securities
.

Meantime
,
regulators
are
becoming
increasingly
worried
as
the
rush
to
leverage
shows
no
signs
of
abating
.

Moody
's
says
the
frequency
of
corporate
credit
downgrades
is
the
highest
this
year
since
1982
.

In
addition
,
there
are
six
times
as
many
troubled
banks
as
there
were
in
the
recession
of
1981
,
according
to
the
Federal
Deposit
Insurance
Corp
.

``
The
era
of
the
1980s
is
about
compound
interest
and
the
reaching
for
it
,
''
says
James
Grant
,
editor
of
Grant
's
Interest
Rate
Observer
,
an
early
critic
of
the
junk
bond
market
.

``
What
we
've
begun
to
see
is
the
damage
to
businesses
of
paying
exorbitant
compound
interest
.

Businesses
were
borrowing
at
interest
rates
higher
than
their
own
earnings
.

What
we
're
seeing
now
is
the
wrenching
readjustment
of
asset
values
to
a
future
when
speculative-grade
debt
will
be
hard
to
obtain
rather
than
easy
.
''

Friday
's
Market
Activity

Prices
of
Treasury
bonds
surged
in
the
biggest
rally
of
the
year
as
investors
fled
a
plummeting
stock
market
.

The
benchmark
30-year
Treasury
bond
was
quoted
6
p.m.
EDT
at
103
12\/32
,
compared
with
100
27\/32
Thursday
,
up
2
1\/2
points
.

The
yield
on
the
benchmark
fell
to
7.82
%
,
the
lowest
since
March
31
,
1987
,
according
to
Technical
Data
Global
Markets
Group
.

The
``
flight
to
quality
''
began
late
in
the
day
and
followed
a
precipitous
fall
in
the
stock
market
.

Treasurys
opened
lower
,
reacting
negatively
to
news
that
the
producer
price
index
--
a
measure
of
inflation
on
the
wholesale
level
--
accelerated
in
September
.

Bond
prices
barely
budged
until
midday
.

Many
bond
market
participants
will
be
closely
eying
the
action
of
the
Federal
Reserve
,
which
might
repeat
its
October
1987
injection
of
huge
amounts
of
liquidity
to
buoy
the
financial
markets
and
keep
the
economy
from
slowing
into
a
recession
.

Prices
of
municipals
,
investment-grade
corporates
and
mortgage-backed
bonds
also
rose
,
but
lagged
behind
their
Treasury
counterparts
.

Mortgage
securities
rose
in
hectic
trading
,
with
most
of
the
activity
concentrated
in
Government
National
Mortgage
Association
9
%
coupon
securities
,
the
most
liquid
mortgage
issue
.

The
Ginnie
Mae
November
9
%
issue
ended
at
98
25\/32
,
up
7\/8
point
on
the
day
,
to
yield
about
9.28
%
to
a
12-year
average
life
assumption
.

Investment-grade
corporate
bonds
were
up
about
1\/2
to
3\/4
point
.

But
the
yield
spread
between
lower-quality
,
investment-grade
issues
and
higher-quality
bonds
widened
.

And
the
yields
on
telephone
and
utility
issues
rose
relative
to
other
investment-grade
bonds
in
anticipation
of
this
week
's
$
3
billion
bond
offering
by
the
Tennessee
Valley
Authority
.

Despite
rumors
that
the
TVA
's
long-awaited
offering
would
be
postponed
because
of
the
debacle
in
the
equity
markets
,
sources
in
the
underwriting
syndicate
said
they
expect
the
issue
will
be
priced
as
scheduled
.

One
of
the
sources
said
the
smaller
portions
of
$
750
million
each
of
five-year
and
10-year
bonds
have
already
been
``
substantially
oversubscribed
.
''

Municipal
bonds
rose
as
much
as
3\/4
point
.

Friday
's
190-point
plunge
in
stocks
does
not
come
atop
the
climate
of
anxiety
that
dominated
financial
markets
just
prior
to
their
1987
October
crash
,
and
mechanisms
have
been
put
in
place
to
keep
markets
more
orderly
.

Still
,
the
lesson
is
about
the
same
:
On
Friday
the
13th
,
the
market
was
spooked
by
Washington
.

The
consensus
along
the
street
seems
to
be
that
the
plunge
was
triggered
by
the
financing
problems
of
the
UAL
takeover
,
and
it
's
certainly
true
the
rout
began
immediately
after
the
UAL
trading
halt
.

Still
,
the
consensus
seems
almost
as
wide
that
one
faltering
bid
is
no
reason
to
write
down
the
value
of
all
U.S.
business
.

This
observation
leads
us
to
another
piece
of
news
moving
on
the
Dow
Jones
ticker
shortly
before
the
downturn
:
the
success
of
Senate
Democrats
in
stalling
the
capital
gains
tax
cut
.

The
real
value
of
all
shares
,
after
all
,
is
directly
impacted
by
the
tax
on
any
profits
(
all
the
more
so
given
the
limits
on
deductions
for
losses
that
show
gains
are
not
``
ordinary
income
''
)
.

And
market
expectations
clearly
have
been
raised
by
the
capital
gains
victory
in
the
House
last
month
.

An
hour
before
Friday
's
plunge
,
that
provision
was
stripped
from
the
tax
bill
,
leaving
it
with
$
5.4
billion
in
tax
increases
without
a
capital
gains
cut
.

There
is
a
great
deal
to
be
said
,
to
be
sure
,
for
stripping
the
garbage
out
of
the
reconciliation
bill
.

It
would
be
a
good
thing
if
Congress
started
to
decide
issues
one-by-one
on
their
individual
merits
without
trickery
.

For
one
thing
,
no
one
doubts
that
the
capital
gains
cut
would
pass
on
an
up-or-down
vote
.

Since
Senate
leaders
have
so
far
fogged
it
up
with
procedural
smokescreens
,
promises
of
a
cleaner
bill
are
suspect
.

Especially
so
since
President
Bush
has
been
weakened
by
the
Panama
fiasco
.

To
the
extent
that
the
UAL
troubles
contributed
to
the
plunge
,
they
are
another
instance
of
Washington
's
sticky
fingers
.

As
the
best
opportunities
for
corporate
restructurings
are
exhausted
of
course
,
at
some
point
the
market
will
start
to
reject
them
.

But
the
airlines
are
scarcely
a
clear
case
,
given
anti-takeover
mischief
by
Secretary
of
Transportation
Skinner
,
who
professes
to
believe
safety
will
be
compromised
if
KLM
and
British
Airways
own
interests
in
companies
that
fly
airplanes
.

Worse
,
Congress
has
started
to
jump
on
the
Skinner
bandwagon
.

James
Oberstar
,
the
Minnesota
Democrat
who
chairs
the
Public
Works
and
Transportation
Committee
's
aviation
subcommittee
,
has
put
an
anti-airline
takeover
bill
on
supersonic
speed
so
that
it
would
be
passed
in
time
to
affect
the
American
and
United
Air
Lines
bids
.

It
would
give
Mr.
Skinner
up
to
50
days
to
``
review
''
any
bid
for
15
%
or
more
of
the
voting
stock
of
any
U.S.
carrier
with
revenues
of
$
1
billion
or
more
.

So
the
UAL
deal
has
problems
,
and
the
market
loses
190
points
.

Congratulations
,
Mr.
Secretary
and
Mr.
Congressman
.

In
the
1987
crash
,
remember
,
the
market
was
shaken
by
a
Danny
Rostenkowski
proposal
to
tax
takeovers
out
of
existance
.

Even
more
important
,
in
our
view
,
was
the
Treasury
's
threat
to
thrash
the
dollar
.

The
Treasury
is
doing
the
same
thing
today
;
thankfully
,
the
dollar
is
not
under
1987-style
pressure
.

Also
,
traders
are
in
better
shape
today
than
in
1987
to
survive
selling
binges
.

They
are
better
capitalized
.

They
are
in
less
danger
of
losing
liquidity
simply
because
of
tape
lags
and
clearing
and
settlement
delays
.

The
Fed
promises
any
needed
liquidity
.

The
Big
Board
's
liaison
with
the
Chicago
Board
of
Trade
has
improved
;
it
will
be
interesting
to
learn
if
``
circuit
breakers
''
prove
to
be
a
good
idea
.

In
any
event
,
some
traders
see
stocks
as
underpriced
today
,
unlike
1987
.

There
is
nothing
wrong
with
the
market
that
ca
n't
be
cured
by
a
little
coherence
and
common
sense
in
Washington
.

But
on
the
bearish
side
,
that
may
be
too
much
to
expect
.

First
Chicago
Corp.
posted
a
third-quarter
loss
of
$
23.3
million
after
joining
other
big
banks
in
further
adding
to
its
reserves
for
losses
on
foreign
loans
.

The
parent
company
of
First
National
Bank
of
Chicago
,
with
$
48
billion
in
assets
,
said
it
set
aside
$
200
million
to
absorb
losses
on
loans
and
investments
in
financially
troubled
countries
.

The
addition
,
on
top
of
two
big
1987
additions
to
foreign-loan
reserves
,
brings
the
reserve
to
a
level
equaling
79
%
of
medium-term
and
long-term
loans
outstanding
to
troubled
nations
.

First
Chicago
since
1987
has
reduced
its
loans
to
such
nations
to
$
1.7
billion
from
$
3
billion
.

Despite
this
loss
,
First
Chicago
said
it
does
n't
need
to
sell
stock
to
raise
capital
.

During
the
quarter
,
the
company
realized
a
pretax
gain
of
$
60.4
million
from
the
sale
of
its
First
Chicago
Investment
Advisors
unit
.

Combined
foreign
exchange
and
bond
trading
profits
dipped
24
%
against
last
year
's
third
quarter
,
to
$
38.2
million
from
$
50.5
million
.

Gains
from
First
Chicago
's
venture
capital
unit
,
a
big
leveraged
buy-out
investor
,
rose
32
%
to
$
34
million
from
$
25.7
million
a
year
ago
.

Interest

Greece
's
second
bout
of
general
elections
this
year
is
slated
for
Nov.
5
.

For
those
hoping
to
see
a
modicum
of
political
normalcy
restored
--
in
view
of
Greece
's
eight-year
misadventure
under
autocratic
pseudosocialism
and
subsequent
three-month
hitch
with
a
conservative-communist
coalition
government
--
there
is
but
one
bright
sign
:
The
scandals
still
encircling
former
Prime
Minister
Andreas
Papandreou
and
his
fallen
socialist
government
are
like
flies
buzzing
around
a
rotting
carcass
.

In
the
mid-June
round
of
voting
,
Greeks
gave
no
clear
mandate
to
any
single
political
party
.

The
ad
interim
coalition
government
that
emerged
from
post-electoral
hagglings
was
,
in
essence
,
little
more
than
the
ill-conceived
offspring
of
ideological
miscegenation
:
On
one
side
,
the
center-right
New
Democracy
Party
,
headed
by
Constantine
Mitsotakis
.

On
the
other
,
the
so-called
Coalition
of
the
Left
and
Progress
--
a
quaint
and
rather
deceptive
title
for
a
merger
of
the
pro-Soviet
Communist
Party
of
Greece
and
its
Euro-Communist
cousin
,
the
Hellenic
Left
.

The
unifying
bond
for
this
left-right
mismatch
was
plain
:
PASOK
(
Mr.
Papandreou
's
party
)
as
common
political
enemy
.

The
ostensible
goal
was
a
mop-up
of
government
corruption
,
purportedly
at
all
levels
,
but
the
main
marks
were
Mr.
Papandreou
and
his
closest
associates
.

In
point
of
fact
,
this
catharsis
was
overdue
by
decades
.

When
reduced
to
buzzword
status
in
ex
parte
pledges
,
however
,
the
notion
transmogrified
into
a
promised
assault
,
with
targets
primarily
for
political
gains
,
not
justice
.

With
regard
to
Greece
's
long-bubbling
bank-looting
scandal
,
Mr.
Papandreou
's
principal
accuser
remains
George
Koskotas
,
former
owner
of
the
Bank
of
Crete
and
self-confessed
embezzler
,
now
residing
in
a
jail
cell
in
Salem
,
Mass.
,
from
where
he
is
fighting
extradition
proceedings
that
would
return
him
to
Greece
.

Mr.
Koskotas
's
credibility
is
,
at
best
,
problematic
.

He
has
ample
motive
to
shift
the
blame
,
and
his
testimony
has
also
been
found
less
than
forthright
on
numerous
points
.

Nevertheless
,
the
New
Democracy
and
Communist
parties
herald
his
assertions
as
proof
of
PASOK
complicity
.

Among
unanswered
questions
are
whether
Mr.
Papandreou
received
$
23
million
of
stolen
Bank
of
Crete
funds
and
an
additional
$
734,000
in
bribes
,
as
contended
;
whether
the
prime
minister
ordered
state
agencies
to
deposit
some
$
57
million
in
Mr.
Koskotas
's
bank
and
then
skim
off
the
interest
;
and
,
what
PASOK
's
cut
was
from
the
$
210
million
Mr.
Koskotas
pinched
.

Two
former
ministers
were
so
heavily
implicated
in
the
Koskotas
affair
that
PASOK
members
of
Parliament
voted
to
refer
them
to
the
special
court
.

But
eluding
parliamentary
probe
was
the
case
of
millions
of
drachmas
Mr.
Koskotas
funneled
into
New
Democracy
coffers
.

In
the
end
,
the
investigation
produced
only
circumstantial
evidence
and
``
indications
''
that
point
to
PASOK
,
not
clinching
proof
.

On
another
issue
,
Greeks
were
told
how
their
national
intelligence
agency
,
the
EYP
,
regularly
monitored
the
telephone
conversations
of
prominent
figures
,
including
key
opposition
politicians
,
journalists
and
PASOK
cabinet
members
.

Despite
convincing
arguments
,
it
was
never
established
that
Mr.
Papandreou
personally
ordered
or
directed
the
wiretaps
.

The
central
weakness
of
the
``
scandals
''
debates
was
pointed
up
especially
well
when
discussions
focused
on
arms
deals
and
kickbacks
.

The
coalition
government
tried
to
show
that
PASOK
ministers
had
received
hefty
sums
for
OKing
the
purchase
of
F-16
Fighting
Falcon
and
Mirage
2000
combat
aircraft
,
produced
by
the
U.S.based
General
Dynamics
Corp.
and
France
's
Avions
Marcel
Dassault
,
respectively
.

Naturally
,
neither
General
Dynamics
nor
Dassault
could
be
expected
to
hamper
its
prospective
future
dealings
by
making
disclosures
of
sums
paid
(
or
not
)
to
various
Greek
officials
for
services
rendered
.

So
it
seems
that
Mr.
Mitsotakis
and
his
communist
chums
may
have
unwittingly
served
Mr.
Papandreou
a
moral
victory
on
a
platter
:
PASOK
,
whether
guilty
or
not
,
can
now
traipse
the
countryside
condemning
the
whole
affair
as
a
witch
hunt
at
Mr.
Papandreou
's
expense
.

But
while
verbal
high
jinks
alone
wo
n't
help
PASOK
regain
power
,
Mr.
Papandreou
should
never
be
underestimated
.

First
came
his
predictable
fusillade
:
He
charged
the
Coalition
of
the
Left
and
Progress
had
sold
out
its
leftist
tenets
by
collaborating
in
a
right-wing
plot
aimed
at
ousting
PASOK
and
thwarting
the
course
of
socialism
in
Greece
.

Then
,
to
buttress
his
credibility
with
the
left
,
he
enticed
some
smaller
leftist
parties
to
stand
for
election
under
the
PASOK
banner
.

Next
,
he
continued
to
court
the
communists
--
many
of
whom
feel
betrayed
by
the
left-right
coalition
's
birth
--
by
bringing
into
PASOK
a
well-respected
Communist
Party
candidate
.

For
balance
,
and
in
hopes
of
gaining
some
disaffected
centrist
votes
,
he
managed
to
attract
a
former
New
Democracy
Party
representative
and
known
political
enemy
of
Mr.
Mitsotakis
.

Thus
PASOK
heads
for
the
polls
not
only
with
diminished
scandal-stench
,
but
also
with
``
seals
of
approval
''
from
representatives
of
its
harshest
accusers
.

Crucial
as
these
elections
are
for
Greece
,
pressing
issues
of
state
are
getting
lost
in
the
shuffle
.

The
country
's
future
NATO
participation
remains
unsure
,
for
instance
.

Greece
also
must
revamp
major
pieces
of
legislation
in
preparation
for
the
1992
targets
of
heightened
Common
Market
cooperation
.

Greece
's
bilateral
relations
with
the
U.S.
need
attention
soon
as
well
.

For
one
,
the
current
accord
concerning
U.S.
military
bases
in
Greece
lapses
in
May
1990
.

Negotiations
for
a
new
agreement
were
frozen
before
the
June
elections
,
but
the
clock
is
running
.

Another
matter
of
concern
is
the
extradition
of
Mohammed
Rashid
,
a
Palestinian
terrorist
who
is
wanted
in
the
U.S.
for
the
1982
bombing
of
a
Pan
American
Airways
flight
.

The
Greek
courts
have
decided
in
favor
of
extradition
in
the
Rashid
case
,
but
the
matter
awaits
final
approval
from
Greece
's
next
justice
minister
.

The
Greeks
seem
barely
aware
of
the
importance
of
the
case
as
a
litmus
test
of
whether
Greece
will
be
counted
in
or
out
for
international
efforts
to
combat
terrorism
.

That
PASOK
could
win
the
elections
outright
is
improbable
;
the
Greek
press
,
previously
eager
to
palm
off
PASOK
's
line
,
has
turned
on
Mr.
Papandreou
with
a
wild-eyed
vengeance
.

Yet
the
possibility
of
another
lash-up
government
is
all
too
real
.

If
Mr.
Papandreou
becomes
the
major
opposition
leader
,
he
could
hamstring
a
conservative-led
coalition
.

Also
,
he
could
force
new
elections
early
next
year
by
frustrating
the
procedures
for
the
election
of
the
president
of
the
republic
in
March
.

New
Democracy
has
once
again
glaringly
underestimated
the
opponent
and
linked
its
own
prospects
to
negative
reaction
against
PASOK
,
forgetting
to
tend
to
either
program
clarity
or
the
rectification
of
internal
squabbles
.

As
for
Mr.
Papandreou
?

He
's
not
exactly
sitting
pretty
at
this
stage
.

But
since
he
is
undoubtedly
one
of
the
most
proficient
bull
slingers
who
ever
raked
muck
,
it
seems
far
wiser
to
view
him
as
sidelined
,
but
certainly
not
yet
eliminated
.

U.S.
OFFICIALS
MOVED
to
head
off
any
repeat
of
Black
Monday
today
following
Friday
's
plunge
in
stock
prices
.

Fed
Chairman
Greenspan
signaled
that
the
central
bank
was
prepared
to
inject
massive
amounts
of
money
into
the
banking
system
to
prevent
a
financial
crisis
.

Other
U.S.
and
foreign
officials
also
mapped
out
plans
,
though
they
kept
their
moves
quiet
to
avoid
making
the
financial
markets
more
jittery
.

Friday
's
sell-off
was
triggered
by
the
collapse
of
UAL
's
buy-out
plan
and
a
big
rise
in
producer
prices
.

The
Dow
Jones
industrials
skidded
190.58
,
to
2569.26
.

The
junk

market
came
to
a

fell
.

Japanese
stocks
dropped
early
Monday
,
but
by
late
morning
were
turning
around
.

The
dollar
was
trading
sharply
lower
in
Tokyo
.

Prospects
for
a
new
UAL
buy-out
proposal
appear
bleak
.

Many
banks
refused
to
back
the
$
6.79
billion
transaction
,
but
bankers
said
it
was
not
from
any
unwillingness
to
finance
takeovers
.

The
decision
was
based
solely
on
problems
with
the
UAL
management-pilot
plan
,
they
said
.

The
surge
in
producer
prices
in
September
followed
three
months
of
declines
,
but
analysts
were
divided
on
whether
the
0.9
%
jump
signaled
a
severe
worsening
of
inflation
.

Also
,
retail
sales
grew
0.5
%
last
month
.

A
capital-gains
tax
cut
was
removed
from
the
Senate
's

but
proponents
still
hope
to
enact

cut
this
year
.

Bush
wo

press
for
a
capital-gains
provision

the
final

House-Senate
conferees
meet

week

General

A
federal
appeals
court
in
San
Francisco
ruled
that
shareholders
ca
n't
hold
corporate
officials
liable
for
false
sales
projections
on
new
products
if
the
news
media
concurrently
revealed
substantial
information
about
the
product
's
flaws
.

The
ruling
stems
from
a
1984
suit
filed
by
shareholders
of
Apple
Computer
Inc.
,
claiming
that
company
officials
misled
investors
about
the
expected
success
of
the
Lisa
computer
,
introduced
in
1983
.

Lawyers
specializing
in
shareholder
suits
said
they
are
concerned
that
use
of
the
``
press
defense
''
by
corporations
may
become
popular
as
a
result
of
the
ruling
.

According
to
the
suit
,
Apple
officials
created
public
excitement
by
touting
Lisa
as
an
office
computer
that
would
revolutionize
the
workplace
and
be
extremely
successful
in
its
first
year
.

The
plaintiffs
also
alleged
that
prior
to
the
fanfare
,
the
company
circulated
internal
memos
indicating
problems
with
Lisa
.

The
suit
claimed
Apple
's
stock
climbed
to
a
high
of
$
63.50
a
share
on
the
basis
of
the
company
's
optimistic
forecasts
.

But
when
the
company
revealed
Lisa
's
poor
sales
late
in
1983
,
the
stock
plummeted
to
a
low
of
$
17.37
a
share
,
according
to
the
suit
.

The
shareholders
claimed
more
than
$
150
million
in
losses
.

In
1987
,
the
San
Francisco
district
court
dismissed
the
case
largely
because
newspaper
reports
had
sufficiently
counterbalanced
the
company
's
statements
by
alerting
consumers
to
Lisa
's
problems
.

Late
last
month
,
the
appeals
court
agreed
that
most
of
the
case
should
be
dismissed
.

However
,
it
gave
the
shareholders
the
right
to
pursue
a
small
portion
of
their
claim
that
pertains
to
Lisa
's
disk
drive
,
known
as
Twiggy
.

The
court
ruled
that
the
news
media

Lawyers
are
worried
about
the
ruling
's
implication
in

shareholder
suits
but
pointed
out
that
the
court
stressed
that
the
ruling
should
be
regarded
as
very
specific
to
the
Apple
case
.

``
The
court
was
careful
to
say
that
the
adverse
information
appeared
in
the
very
same
articles
and
received
the
same
attention
as
the
company
's
statements

Patrick
Grannon
,
a
Los
Angeles
lawyer
at
the
firm
of
Greenfield
&
Chimicles
,
which
was
n't
involved
in
the
case
.

``
The
court
is
saying
that
the
adverse
facts
have
to
be
transferred
to
the
market
with
equal
intensity
and
credibility
as
the

NFL
ORDERED
to
pay
$
5.5
million
in
legal
fees
to
defunct

The
National
Football
League
is
considering
appealing
the
ruling
stemming
from
the
U.S.
Football
League
's
largely
unsuccessful
antitrust
suit
against
the
NFL
.

A
jury
in
1986
agreed
with
the
USFL
's
claims
that
the
NFL
monopolized
major
league
football
.

But
the
jury
awarded
the
USFL
only
$
1
in
damages
,
trebled
because
of
the
antitrust
claims
.

Last
week
,
the
U.S.
Court
of
Appeals
in
New
York
upheld
a
$
5.5
million
award
of
attorneys
fees
to
the
defunct
league
.

Harvey
D.
Myerson
,
of
Myerson
&
Kuhn
,
then
of
Finley
,
Kumble
,
Wagner
,
Heine
,
Underberg
,
Manley
,
Myerson
&
Casey
,
was
the
lead
trial
lawyer
,
and
his
new
firm
pursued
the
application
appeal
.

Douglas
R.
Pappas
of
Myerson
&
Kuhn
says
about
$
5.3
million
of
the
award
goes
directly
to
the
USFL
to
reimburse
it
for
fees
already
paid
.

Myerson
&
Kuhn
will
get
about
$
260,000
for
the
costs
of
pressing
the
application
.

The
federal
appeals
court
held
that
the
nominal
damages
and
the
failure
to
prove
all
claims
did
n't
exclude
the
USFL
from
being
reimbursed
.

Antitrust
laws
provide
that
injured
parties
may
be
reimbursed
for
lawyers
'
fees
.

But
Shepard
Goldfein
,
an
attorney
for
the
NFL
,
says
his
client
will
consider
asking
for
another
hearing
or
appealing
to
the
U.S.
Supreme
Court
.

Mr.
Goldfein
,
of
Skadden
,
Arps
,
Slate
,
Meagher
&
Flom
in
New
York
,
says
the
ruling
is
wrong
and
the
fee
award
is
excessive
because
the
USFL
lost
its
major
claims
,
including
its
contention
that
the
NFL
restrained
trade
through
television
contracts
.

``
The
USFL
was
not
the
prevailing
party
,
''
Mr.
Goldfein
insists
.

HOUSTON-CALGARY
ALLIANCE
:

Fulbright
&
Jaworski
of
Houston
and
Fenerty
,
Robertson
,
Fraser
&
Hatch
of
Calgary
,
Alberta
,
are
affiliating
to
help
serve
their
energy-industry
clients
.

The
affiliation
is
believed
to
be
the
first
such
cross-border
arrangement
among
major
law
firms
.

The
firms
are
n't
required
to
refer
work
exclusively
to
each
other
and
remain
separate
organizations
.

But
they
will
work
together
on
energy
-
,
environmental
-
and
fair-trade-related
issues
and
conduct
seminars
on
topics
of
mutual
interest
,
said
Gibson
Gayle
Jr.
of
585-lawyer
Fulbright
&
Jaworski
.

In
addition
,
Fulbright
&
Jaworski
's
Washington
,
D.C.
,
office
will
play
a
key
role
as
the
firms
work
together
on
regulatory
issues
,
particularly
natural-gas
exports
,
for
their
clients
.

The
arrangement
,
reached
after
about
eight
months
of
negotiations
,
grew
out
of
80-lawyer
Fenerty
Robertson
's
desire
to
develop
ties
with
a
U.S.
firm
in
light
of
relaxed
trade
barriers
between
the
U.S.
and
Canada
,
said
Francis
M.
Saville
of
Fenerty
Robertson
.

IN
WHAT
MAY
SIGNAL
a
turnaround
for
asbestos
manufacturers
,
W.R.
Grace
&
Co.
won
a
3
1\/2-week
trial
in
Pittsburgh
over
whether
it
should
be
required
to
remove
asbestos
fireproofing
from
a
local
high
school
.

Mount
Lebanon
High
School
,
near
Pittsburgh
,
sought
$
21
million
in
compensatory
damages
from
Grace
,
arguing
that
the
asbestos
,
which
can
cause
respiratory
diseases
and
lung
cancer
,
posed
a
risk
to
students
.

Grace
successfully
contended
that
removing
the
fire
retardant
would
pose
a
greater
health
risk
than
leaving
it
alone
.

A
spokesman
for
the
company
said
the
verdict
is
thought
to
be
the
first
in
favor
of
an
asbestos
manufacturer
where
the
plaintiff
was
a
school
and
the
asbestos
in
question
was
used
for
fireproofing
.

of
the
venture
and
a
Matsushita

,
Matsushita

Roger
Rosenblatt
,
editor
of
U.S.
News
&
World
Report
,
resigned
Friday
from
the
weekly
news
magazine
.

Mr.
Rosenblatt
said
he
resigned
because
of
difficulties
with
commuting
between
his
home
in
New
York
and
the
magazine
's
editorial
offices
in
Washington
.

``
Frankly
,
I
missed
my
family
,
''
said
Mr.
Rosenblatt
.

In
Mr.
Rosenblatt
's
tenure
,
the
magazine
's
advertising
pages
and
circulation
have
grown
significantly
.

But
at
2.3
million
weekly
paid
circulation
,
U.S.
News
still
ranks
third
behind
Time
Warner
Inc.
's
Time
magazine
,
with
4.4
million
circulation
,
and
Washington
Post
Co.
's
Newsweek
,
with
3.3
million
circulation
.

Mortimer
B.
Zuckerman
,
chairman
and
editor
in
chief
,
said
Mr.
Rosenblatt
would
be
succeeded
starting
today
by
Michael
Ruby
,
the
magazine
's
executive
editor
,
and
Merrill
McLoughlin
,
a
senior
writer
.

Mr.
Ruby
and
Ms.
McLoughlin
are
married
to
each
other
.

Mr.
Zuckerman
said
his
magazine
would
maintain
its
editorial
format
,
which
is
a
mix
of
analysis
and
trend
stories
with
service-oriented
,
how-to
articles
.

Mr.
Rosenblatt
,
a
senior
writer
at
Time
magazine
before
joining
U.S.
News
&
World
Report
,
said
he
had
numerous
job
offers
from
other
magazines
while
he
was
editor
.

The
offers
were
to
work
as
a
writer
,
not
an
editor
.

He
said
he
will
now
consider
those
offers
.

Avions
Marcel
Dassault-Breguet
Aviation
S.A.
said
group
profit
before
taxes
and
contributions
to
employee
profit-sharing
soared
97
%
to
839
million
francs
(
$
129.6
million
)
in
the
first
half
of
1989
from
425
million
francs
a
year
earlier
.

The
French
aircraft
group
pointed
out
,
however
,
that
financial
results
from
its
sector
of
industry
are
frequently
erratic
because
of
irregular
cash
flow
from
large
contracts
.

It
noted
,
for
example
,
that
group
revenue
for
the
first
half
was
8.734
billion
francs
,
down
about
12
%
from
9.934
billion
francs
a
year
earlier
.

Still
,
it
said
it
expects
sales
for
all
of
1989
to
be
on
the
order
of
20
billion
francs
,
reflecting
anticipated
billings
for
two
large
contracts
in
the
second
half
of
the
year
.

For
all
of
1988
,
Dassault
had
group
profit
of
428
million
francs
on
revenue
of
18.819
billion
francs
.

The
group
has
n't
yet
released
earnings
figures
for
the
first
half
of
1989
,
nor
has
it
made
a
detailed
forecast
of
its
full-year
earnings
.

Keystone
Consolidated
Industries
Inc.
expects
to
report
earnings
before
extraordinary
tax
benefits
of
about
$
1.5
million
,
or
about
41
cents
a
share
,
for
the
third
quarter
,
compared
with
a
loss
last
year
,
said
Glenn
R.
Simmons
,
chairman
and
chief
executive
officer
.

After
a
tax
benefit
of
about
$
780,000
,
Keystone
expects
to
report
net
income
of
$
2.3
million
,
or
about
62
cents
a
share
,
Mr.
Simmons
said
.

For
third
quarter
last
year
,
Keystone
reported
a
$
1
million
loss
from
continuing
operations
and
a
$
200,000
loss
from
discontinued
operations
,
for
a
net
loss
of
$
1.2
million
.

Revenue
for
the
latest
third
quarter
was
about
$
70.5
million
,
up
10
%
from
$
63.6
million
last
year
,
he
said
.

Mr.
Simmons
said
the
results
signal
a
turnaround
for
the
maker
of
wire
and
wire
products
,
which
has
struggled
to
remain
competitive
in
the
face
of
lower-priced
,
imported
steel
.

A
new
$
46
million
steel
rod
minimill
,
which
got
off
to
a
rocky
start
in
early
1988
,
now
is
running
efficiently
and
a
new
management
team
is
more
heavily
marketing
Keystone
's
products
,
Mr.
Simmons
said
.

As
a
result
,
the
company
hopes
to
report
net
income
for
the
year
of
about
$
11.6
million
,
or
about
$
3.10
to
$
3.15
a
share
,
compared
with
a
net
loss
of
$
24.4
million
last
year
,
after
a
loss
from
discontinued
operations
of
$
18.4
million
.

Revenue
for
1989
is
expected
to
be
about
$
300
million
,
up
about
21
%
from
$
247.3
million
in
1988
.

For
the
nine
months
ended
Sept.
30
,
Keystone
expects
to
report
net
income
of
$
9.3
milion
,
or
about
$
2.53
a
share
,
after
an
extraordinary
gain
from
$
3.2
million
in
tax
benefits
.

Last
year
,
the
company
had
a
net
loss
of
$
6.5
million
,
including
a
$
6.1
million
loss
from
continuing
operations
and
a
$
400,000
loss
from
discontinued
operations
.

Revenue
for
the
nine
months
is
expected
to
be
about
$
230.5
million
,
up
about
21
%
from
$
190.4
million
last
year
.

Mr.
Simmons
said
Keystone
's
new
mill
is
expected
to
produce
about
585,000
tons
of
steel
rods
this
year
,
up
from
413,000
tons
in
1988
.

Production
at
the
mill
has
exceeded
the
ability
of
Keystone
's
casting
operation
to
supply
it
,
he
said
,
which
will
force
Keystone
to
purchase
billet
,
or
unfinished
steel
bars
,
from
outside
the
company
during
the
fourth
quarter
and
next
year
.

Keystone
will
have
to
consider
expanding
its
casting
operation
,
at
an
estimated
cost
of
$
8
million
to
$
10
million
,
within
the
next
18
to
24
months
,
Mr.
Simmons
said
.

Under
Robert
W.
Singer
,
who
was
named
president
and
chief
operating
officer
last
year
,
Keystone
has
expanded
its
sales
force
to
about
20
people
from
about
15
and
hopes
to
expand
its
sales
from
the
middle
portion
of
the
country
toward
the
East
and
West
coasts
.

``
Prior
to
a
year
ago
,
Keystone
was
an
order-taker
.

Now
I
think
we
have
a
group
of
marketing
people
who
are
out
selling
to
retailers
and
wholesalers
,
''
Mr.
Simmons
said
.

Still
,
he
said
,
the
100-year-old
company
plans
to
continue
its
premium-priced
strategy
for
its
distinctive
brand
of
red-tipped
wire
fencing
and
other
products
.

The
company
claims
a
40
%
share
of
the
U.S.
field
fence
business
,
a
35
%
share
of
poultry
netting
sales
and
a
30
%
share
of
barbed
wire
sales
.

Freeport-McMoRan
Inc.
said
a
temporary
cessation
of
operations
at
its
Sunshine
Bridge
uranium-recovery
facility
in
Donaldsonville
,
La.
,
will
result
in
slight
earnings
improvement
to
both
the
company
and
its
Freeport-McMoRan
Resource
Partners
Limited
Partnership
unit
.

The
company
did
n't
elaborate
.

The
diversified
energy
and
minerals
concern
said
that
a
depressed
uranium
market
is
responsible
for
the
temporary
mothballing
of
the
plant
,
but
that
the
plant
can
be
reactivated
quickly
when
the
market
improves
.

More
than
400,000
pounds
of
uranium
a
year
have
been
produced
at
the
facility
during
the
past
seven
years
.

A
second
uranium-recovery
plant
at
Uncle
Sam
,
La.
,
that
produces
more
than
700,000
pounds
of
uranium
annually
,
will
continue
to
operate
.

Freeport-McMoRan
said
the
shutdown
wo
n't
affect
sales
volumes
under
long-term
sales
contracts
of
its
Freeport
Uranium
Recovery
Co.
unit
,
but
will
reduce
the
amount
of
product
sold
on
the
spot
market
.

Business
Week
subscribers
may
hear
this
week
's
issue
talking
back
to
them
.

A
four-page
ad
from
Texas
Instruments
Inc.
,
running
in
approximately
140,000
issues
of
the
Oct.
20
``
Corporate
Elite
''
issue
of
the
McGraw-Hill
Inc.
publication
,
contains
a
speech
synthesizer
laminated
between
two
of
the
pages
.

Readers
who
pull
off
a
piece
of
tape
and
press
a
switch
will
hear
a
tiny
--
but
distinctly
human-sounding
--
voice
announce
,
``
I
am
the
talking
chip
,
''
as
it
launches
into
a
15-second
discourse
on
its
own
attributes
.

The
talking
chip
is
n't
cheap
--
the
per-ad
cost
to
Texas
Instruments
is
about
$
4
,
and
that
's
without
adding
in
Business
Week
's
charge
--
but
Texas
Instruments
believes
it
is
a
first
.

Previous
efforts
have
included
musical
ads
,
featuring
simple
tone-generating
chips
that
play
a
tune
,
but
the
voice
synthesizer
in
this
effort
is
much
more
sophisticated
,
with
none
of
the
robotic
flatness
that
one
hears
,
for
example
,
when
calling
telephone
directory
services
.

And
for
those
who
miss
the
message
the
first
time
around
,
not
to
worry
:
Three
tiny
batteries
provide
enough
juice
for
as
many
as
650
replays

Lomas
Financial
Corp.
,
Dallas
,
said
it
will
ask
a
U.S.
bankruptcy
court
to
allow
it
to
hire
Lazard
Freres
&
Co.
to
help
it
sell
its
leasing
unit
.

Lomas
,
assisted
by
Merrill
Lynch
Capital
Markets
,
has
been
trying
to
sell
its
Equitable
Lomas
Leasing
Co.
for
several
months
,
apparently
without
success
.

The
real
estate
and
mortgage
banking
concern
had
hoped
to
use
proceeds
from
the
sale
to
reduce
its
debt
.

Without
cash
from
asset
sales
and
unable
to
reach
a
new
bank-credit
agreement
,
Lomas
defaulted
on
$
145
million
in
notes
that
became
due
Sept.
1
.

It
filed
for
protection
from
creditors
under
Chapter
11
of
the
federal
Bankruptcy
Code
Sept.
24
to
give
it
additional
time
to
work
on
a
plan
to
restructure
its
$
1.45
billion
in
senior
debt
.

Lomas
said
Merrill
Lynch
,
which
owns
bonds
and
equity
in
Lomas
,
could
n't
continue
as
Lomas
's
investment
banker
because
it
is
also
a
creditor
.

It
said
it
chose
Lazard
in
part
because
of
Lazard
's
offices
in
Europe
and
Japan
,
where
investors
might
be
interested
in
a
U.S.
leasing
company
.

Canadian
Imperial
Bank
of
Commerce
said
it
will
increase
its
loan-loss
provisions
to
cover
all
its
loans
to
lesser
developed
countries
,
except
Mexico
,
resulting
in
an
after-tax
charge
to
1989
earnings
of
300
million
Canadian
dollars
(
US$
255
million
)
.

Don
Bowder
,
senior
vice
president
and
chief
accountant
,
said
the
bank
's
strong
earnings
enable
it
to
be
the
first
major
Canadian
bank
to
set
aside
provisions
covering
all
its
C$
1.17
billion
in
non-Mexican
LDC
debt
.

``
It
eliminates
the
continuing
uncertainty
with
respect
to
the
ultimate
value
of
the
loans
,
''
he
said
.

The
bank
said
about
C$
525
million
will
be
added
to
its
existing
LDC
and
general
loss
provisions
in
its
fourth
quarter
,
ending
Oct.
31
.

Mr.
Bowder
said
the
C$
300
million
charge
to
earnings
would
amount
to
about
C$
1.34
a
share
.

The
bank
's
net
income
for
the
nine
months
ended
July
31
was
C$
577
million
,
or
C$
3.10
a
share
.

Mr.
Bowder
said
the
bank
will
restructure
its
C$
604
million
of
Mexican
debt
,
of
which
C$
255
million
is
in
Mexican
notes
secured
by
U.S.
government
bonds
.

The
bank
has
a
45
%
reserve
against
the
remaining
C$
349
million
of
Mexican
debt
and
expects
to
swap
that
for
other
Mexican
notes
supported
by
U.S.
Treasury
zero-coupon
bonds
.

Mr.
Bowder
said
the
bank
's
experience
with
LDC
debt
has
been
``
painful
''
and
this
latest
move
represents
the
final
phase
of
a
program
begun
seven
years
ago
to
reduce
its
exposure
through
provisioning
,
debt
sales
and
debt
swaps
.

He
said
the
bank
will
no
longer
participate
in
LDC
sovereign
lending
,
but
will
support
trade
financing
and
other
transactions
that
meet
the
bank
's
standards
.

The
carnage
among
takeover
stocks
Friday
does
n't
mean
the
end
of
mega-mergers
but
simply
marks
the
start
of
a
less
ambitious
game
,
Wall
Street
's
big-time
deal
makers
say
.

Suitors
from
now
on
are
more
likely
to
be
expansion-minded
companies
,
rather
than
raiders
or
debt-happy
financiers
.

And
they
will
be
launching
lower-priced
and
perhaps
fewer
deals
,
now
that
it
's
tougher
to
finance
them
.

This
is
an
ominous
sign
for
a
stock
market
that
lately
has
been
fueled
by
takeover
speculation
and
bidding
wars
for
companies
that
put
themselves
up
for
sale
.

Whenever
the
1980s
merger
boom
seems
to
be
stalling
,
shock
waves
ripple
through
the
stock
market
.

``
The
market
is
overvalued
,
not
cheap
,
''
says
Alan
Gaines
of
the
New
York
money-management
firm
Gaines
Berland
.

He
recently
began
increasing
his
cash
position
to
45
%
of
his
portfolio
.

``
I
look
at
where
deals
can
get
done
,
''
he
says
,
``
and
they
're
not
getting
done
''
at
current
prices
.

Lenders
are
growing
increasingly
nervous
about
debt-financed
takeovers
,
investment
bankers
say
.

``
You
had
a
week
of
a
deteriorating
junk-bond
market
that
ran
smack
into
the
news
on
Friday
about
what
appeared
to
be
happening
to
the
bank
debt
market
,
''
says
Steven
Rattner
,
a
partner
and
merger
specialist
with
Lazard
Freres
&
Co
.

Trading
dried
up
Friday
in
the
market
for
high-yield
junk
bonds
,
often
used
to
finance
takeovers
.

It
was
the
latest
in
a
series
of
setbacks
for
the
junk
bond
market
,
where
prices
began
weakening
last
month
after
Campeau
hit
a
cash
crunch
.

And
banks
appear
to
be
taking
an
increasingly
skeptical
view
of
requests
for
high-risk
takeover
loans
.

The
group
trying
to
buy
UAL
announced
Friday
that
it
could
n't
arrange
the
$
7.2
billion
in
bank
loans
it
needs
to
buy
the
parent
of
United
Airlines
for
$
300
a
share
.

Takeover-stock
traders
today
will
be
scrambling
to
learn
of
any
UAL
developments
,
and
other
takeover
stocks
are
likely
to
trade
in
sympathy
.

Investment
bankers
representing
the
buy-out
group
and
UAL
's
board
spent
a
frantic
weekend
trying
to
hammer
out
new
terms
that
would
be
more
acceptable
to
the
banks
.

After
UAL
,
the
stock
viewed
as
most
vulnerable
is
American
Airlines
'
parent
AMR
,
the
target
of
a
$
120-a-share
takeover
proposal
from
New
York
real
estate
developer
Donald
Trump
.

Trading
in
AMR
shares
was
suspended
shortly
after
3
p.m.
EDT
Friday
and
did
n't
resume
.

Before
the
halt
,
AMR
last
traded
at
98
5\/8
.

Late
Friday
night
,
the
London
office
of
Jefferies
&
Co.
,
a
Los
Angeles
securities
firm
,
traded
AMR
shares
at
prices
as
low
as
80
.

Similarly
,
Delta
Air
Lines
and
USAir
Group
dropped
10.1
%
and
8.5
%
,
respectively
,
on
Friday
and
could
weaken
further
.

Over
the
weeked
,
however
,
two
developments
in
other
deals
indicated
that
commerical
banks
and
Wall
Street
firms
still
are
willing
to
commit
billions
of
dollars
to
finance
takeover
bids
launched
by
major
companies
.

Vitro
S.A.
,
a
major
Mexican
glass
maker
,
said
yesterday
that
it
agreed
to
buy
Anchor
Glass
Container
in
a
tender
offer
for
$
21.25
a
share
,
sweetened
from
the
original
$
20-a-share
offer
Vitro
launched
two
months
ago
.

On
Friday
,
Anchor
shares
fell
1
1\/4
to
close
at
18
1\/2
.

For
the
broader
market
,
the
greatest
significance
of
the
Vitro-Anchor
deal
may
be
that
it
was
put
together
late
Friday
night
--
after
the
market
rout
--
and
involves
a
$
155
million
temporary
``
bridge
''
loan
from
Donaldson
,
Lufkin
&
Jenrette
Securities
and
a
$
139
million
loan
from
Security
Pacific
National
Bank
.

Moreover
,
to
complete
the
entire
Anchor
Glass
purchase
and
refinance
existing
debt
,
Donaldson
said
it
is
``
highly
confident
''
that
it
will
be
able
to
sell
$
400
million
of
junk
bonds
for
Vitro
,
despite
the
current
disarray
in
the
junk
bond
market
.

Donaldson
's
statement
is
n't
merely
an
idle
boast
,
because
those
bonds
will
have
to
be
sold
before
Donaldson
's
bridge
loan
can
be
paid
back
.

Security
Pacific
,
meanwhile
,
said
it
expects
to
arrange
$
430
million
in
bank
loans
for
Vitro
.

In
another
takeover
battle
,
a
spokesman
for
McCaw
Cellular
Communications
said
yesterday
that
McCaw
has
been
advised
by
three
commercial
banks
that
they
remain
``
highly
confident
''
they
can
arrange
$
4.5
billion
of
bank
loans
for
McCaw
's
tender
offer
for
about
45
%
of
LIN
Broadcasting
,
``
notwithstanding
recent
events
.
''

McCaw
is
offering
$
125
a
share
for
22
million
LIN
shares
,
thereby
challenging
LIN
's
proposal
to
spin
off
its
television
properties
,
pay
shareholders
a
$
20-a-share
special
dividend
and
combine
its
cellular-telephone
operations
with
BellSouth
's
cellular
business
.

On
Friday
,
LIN
shares
were
among
the
few
takeover
issues
that
did
n't
fall
much
,
dropping
5
1\/2
,
or
4.9
%
,
to
close
at
107
1\/2
.

Traders
and
investment
bankers
said
LIN
shares
were
n't
hurt
much
because
BellSouth
is
viewed
as
a
well-financed
corporate
buyer
unlikely
to
be
affected
by
skittishness
among
bankers
or
bond
buyers
.

Investment
bankers
interviewed
over
the
weekend
see
a
silver
lining
for
the
merger
business
in
the
stock-market
drop
.

Potential
bidders
for
companies
``
were
saying
that
things
were
beginning
to
look
expensive
,
''
says
Mr.
Rattner
of
Lazard
.

``
Nothing
makes
things
look
cheaper
than
a
200-point
drop
in
the
Dow
,
''
Mr.
Rattner
says
.

``
Just
as
there
are
people
waiting
to
become
bargain
hunters
in
the
stock
market
,
there
are
people
waiting
to
become
bargain
hunters
in
the
deal
market
.
''

Investment
bankers
expect
most
of
those
bargain
hunters
to
be
well-heeled
corporations
.

``
In
the
past
,
corporate
buyers
were
often
discouraged
from
making
bids
because
of
competition
from
LBO
firms
,
which
were
often
prepared
to
outbid
''
the
corporations
,
says
J.
Tomilson
Hill
,
head
of
mergers
and
acquisitions
at
Shearson
Lehman
Hutton
.

Now
,
``
corporate
buyers
should
be
willing
to
re-enter
the
acquisition
market
because
the
competition
from
junkbond-financed
buyers
has
been
reduced
.
''

Many
takeover
stocks
plunged
Friday
,
as
speculators
retained
their
confidence
in
corporate
buyers
but
fled
from
the
socalled
whisper
stocks
,
the
targets
of
rumored
deals
.

Columbia
Pictures
Entertainment
,
which
has
agreed
to
a
friendly
$
27-a-share
bid
from
Sony
of
Japan
,
fell
only
1\/8
to
close
at
26
5\/8
.

But
several
stocks
long
rumored
to
be
ripe
for
a
takeover
or
restructuring
fell
10
%
or
more
.

They
include
USX
,
down
11.7
%
;
Upjohn
,
down
11.1
%
;
Campbell
Soup
,
down
11
%
;
Paramount
Communications
,
off
10.3
%
;
Woolworth
,
down
10.2
%
;
Delta
Air
Lines
,
down
10.1
%
,
and
MCA
,
down
9.7
%
.

The
market
--
and
investment
bankers
--
are
even
less
sanguine
about
companies
that
have
had
at
least
one
bid
,
merger
agreement
or
restructuring
plan
fall
through
already
.

Given
the
weakness
in
both
the
junk
bond
market
and
the
stock
market
,
traders
fear
that
these
transactions
may
be
revised
yet
again
.

Examples
include
Kollmorgen
,
whose
agreement
to
be
acquired
for
$
25
a
share
by
Vernitron
collapsed
last
month
.

Kollmorgen
shares
fell
nearly
20
%
on
Friday
to
close
at
12
7\/8
.

Ramada
,
which
first
delayed
and
then
shelved
a
$
400
million
junk
bond
sale
that
was
designed
to
help
finance
a
restructuring
,
fell
15.6
%
to
close
at
9
1\/2
.

Ramada
has
said
it
hopes
to
propose
a
new
restructuring
plan
but
has
n't
indicated
when
it
will
do
so
.

Shares
of
American
Medical
International
,
which
agreed
last
week
to
accept
a
lower
price
from
a
buy-out
group
that
includes
First
Boston
Corp.
and
the
Pritzker
family
of
Chicago
,
fell
15.8
%
on
Friday
to
close
at
20
.

The
buy-out
group
is
offering
$
26.50
a
share
for
63
million
American
Medical
shares
,
down
from
its
offer
in
July
of
$
28
a
share
for
68.8
million
shares
.

But
investment
bankers
say
the
market
may
have
oversold
some
takeover-related
stocks
.

Hilton
Hotels
,
for
example
,
was
among
the
worst-hit
issues
,
falling
20.2
%
to
close
at
85
,
down
21
1\/2
on
Friday
.

Hilton
currently
is
soliciting
bids
for
a
sale
of
part
or
all
of
its
hotel
and
casino
businesses
.

People
familiar
with
Hilton
said
over
the
weekend
that
the
depth
of
the
sell-off
in
Hilton
shares
was
unwarranted
because
none
of
the
likely
buyers
would
be
dependent
on
junk-bond
financing
.

However
,
they
conceded
that
some
potential
bidders
would
rely
on
bank
loans
and
would
be
hurt
if
the
troubles
of
the
UAL
buy-out
group
signified
a
general
unwillingness
among
banks
to
provide
credit
for
debt-financed
takeovers
.

Hilton
officials
said
they
were
n't
worried
about
the
drop
in
the
company
's
stock
.

William
Lebo
,
Hilton
's
general
counsel
,
said
plans
to
consider
a
sale
of
the
company
or
some
of
its
assets
are
``
on
track
''
for
what
has
been
described
previously
as
``
a
slow
and
deliberate
process
.
''

``
I
ca
n't
believe
that
any
potential
buyer
for
Hilton
would
be
affected
by
one
day
's
trading
,
''
Mr.
Lebo
said
.

But
the
stock
market
as
a
whole
,
bolstered
as
it
is
by
takeover
speculation
,
remains
vulnerable
to
any
further
pullback
by
takeover
financiers
,
both
in
the
junkbond
market
and
among
commercial
banks
.

For
debt-ridden
suitors
,
``
the
takeover
game
has
been
over
for
some
time
,
''
says
New
York
money
manager
Neil
Weisman
of
Chilmark
Capital
,
who
has
been
keeping
85
%
of
his
portfolio
in
cash
.

``
The
market
is
just
waking
up
to
that
point
.
''

Pauline
Yoshihashi
in
Los
Angeles
contributed

this
column

Of
all
the
one-time
expenses
incurred
by
a
corporation
or
professional
firm
,
few
are
larger
or
longer
term
than
the
purchase
of
real
estate
or
the
signing
of
a
commercial
lease
.

To
take
full
advantage
of
the
financial
opportunities
in
this
commitment
,
however
,
the
corporation
or
professional
firm
must
do
more
than
negotiate
the
best
purchase
price
or
lease
terms
.

It
must
also
evaluate
the
real-estate
market
in
the
chosen
location
from
a
new
perspective
.

Specifically
,
it
must
understand
how
real-estate
markets
overreact
to
shifts
in
regional
economies
and
then
take
advantage
of
these
opportunities
.

When
a
regional
economy
catches
cold
,
the
local
real-estate
market
gets
pneumonia
.

In
other
words
,
real-estate
market
indicators
,
such
as
building
permits
and
leasing
activity
,
plummet
much
further
than
a
local
economy
in
recession
.

This
was
seen
in
the
late
1960s
in
Los
Angeles
and
the
mid-1970s
in
New
York
.

But
the
reverse
is
also
true
:
When
a
region
's
economy
rebounds
from
a
slowdown
,
these
real-estate
indicators
will
rebound
far
faster
than
the
improving
economy
.

Why
do
local
real-estate
markets
overreact
to
regional
economic
cycles
?

Because
real-estate
purchases
and
leases
are
such
major
long-term
commitments
that
most
companies
and
individuals
make
these
decisions
only
when
confident
of
future
economic
stability
and
growth
.

Metropolitan
Detroit
was
written
off
economically
during
the
early
1980s
,
as
the
domestic
auto
industry
suffered
a
serious
sales
depression
and
adjustment
.

Area
employment
dropped
by
13
%
from
its
1979
peak
and
retail
sales
were
down
14
%
.

However
,
the
real-estate
market
was
hurt
even
more
.

For
example
,
residential
building
permits
in
the
trough
year
of
1982
were
off
76
%
from
the
1979
peak
level
.

Once
metropolitan
Detroit
's
economy
rallied
in
the
mid-1980s
,
real
estate
rebounded
.

Building
permits
,
for
example
,
soared
a
staggering
400
%
between
1982
and
the
peak
year
of
1986
.

Where
,
savvy
corporations
and
professional
firms
are
now
asking
,
are
today
's
opportunities
?

Look
no
further
than
metropolitan
Houston
and
Denver
,
two
of
the
most
depressed
,
overbuilt
and
potentially
undervalued
real-estate
markets
in
the
nation
.

Of
course
,
some
observers
have
touted
Houston
and
Denver
for
the
past
five
years
as
a
counter-cyclical
play
.

But
now
appears
to
be
the
time
to
act
.

Metropolitan
Houston
's
economy
did
drop
and
then
flatten
in
the
years
after
its
1982
peak
.

In
the
mid-1980s
,
employment
was
down
as
much
as
5
%
from
the
1982
peak
and
retail
sales
were
off
13
%
.

The
real-estate
market
suffered
even
more
severe
setbacks
.

Office
construction
dropped
97
%
.

The
vacancy
rate
soared
more
than
20
%
in
nearly
every
product
category
,
and
more
than
30
%
of
office
space
was
vacant
.

To
some
observers
,
the
empty
office
buildings
of
Houston
's
``
see-through
skyline
''
were
indicative
of
a
very
troubled
economy
.

As
usual
,
the
real-estate
market
had
overreacted
.

Actually
,
the
region
's
economy
retained
a
firm
foundation
.

Metropolitan
Houston
's
population
has
held
steady
over
the
past
six
years
.

And
personal
income
,
after
slumping
in
the
mid-1980s
,
has
returned
to
its
1982
level
in
real
dollar
terms
.

Today
,
metropolitan
Houston
's
real-estate
market
is
poised
for
a
significant
turnaround
.

More
than
42,000
jobs
were
added
in
metro
Houston
last
year
,
primarily
in
biotechnology
,
petrochemical
processing
,
and
the
computer
industry
.

This
growth
puts
Houston
in
the
top
five
metro
areas
in
the
nation
last
year
.

And
forecasts
project
a
2.5
%
to
3
%
growth
rate
in
jobs
over
the
next
few
years
--
nearly
twice
the
national
average
.

Denver
is
another
metropolitan
area
where
the
commercial
real-estate
market
has
overreacted
to
the
region
's
economic
trends
,
although
Denver
has
not
experienced
as
severe
an
economic
downturn
as
Houston
.

By
some
measures
,
metropolitan
Denver
's
economy
has
actually
improved
in
the
past
four
years
.

Its
population
has
continued
to
increase
since
1983
,
the
peak
year
of
the
economic
cycle
.

Employment
is
now
4
%
higher
than
in
1983
.

Buying
income
in
real
dollars
actually
increased
15
%
between
1983
and
1987
(
the
most
recent
year
available
)
.

The
rates
of
increase
,
however
,
are
less
than
the
rapid
growth
of
the
boom
years
,
and
this
has
resulted
in
a
loss
of
confidence
in
the
economy
.

In
a
self-fulfilling
prophecy
,
therefore
,
the
region
's
real-estate
market
all
but
collapsed
in
recent
years
.

Housing
building
permits
are
down
more
than
75
%
from
their
1983
peaks
.

Although
no
one
can
predict
when
metropolitan
Denver
's
real-estate
market
will
rebound
,
major
public
works
projects
costing
several
billion
dollars
are
under
way
or
planned
--
such
as
a
new
convention
center
,
a
major
beltway
encircling
the
metropolitan
area
,
and
a
new
regional
airport
.

When
Denver
's
regional
economy
begins
to
grow
faster
--
such
a
recovery
could
occur
as
early
as
next
year
--
business
and
consumer
confidence
will
return
,
and
the
resulting
explosion
of
real-estate
activity
will
dwarf
the
general
economic
rebound
.

What
real-estate
strategy
should
one
follow
in
a
metropolitan
area
whose
economic
health
is
not
as
easy
to
determine
as
Houston
's
or
Denver
's
?

Generally
,
overcapacity
in
commercial
real
estate
is
dropping
from
its
mid-1980s
peak
,
even
in
such
economically
healthy
metropolitan
areas
as
Washington
,
New
York
and
Los
Angeles
.

Vacancy
rates
in
the
15
%
to
19
%
range
today
may
easily
rise
to
the
low
to
mid-20
%
range
in
a
couple
of
years
.

Under
these
conditions
,
even
a
flattening
out
of
economic
growth
--
``
catching
cold
''
--
in
the
healthy
metropolitan
areas
will
create
significant
opportunities
for
corporations
and
professional
service
firms
looking
for
bargains
as
the
realestate
industry
catches
pneumonia
.

Those
looking
for
real-estate
bargains
in
distressed
metropolitan
areas
should
lock
in
leases
or
buy
now
;
those
looking
in
healthy
metropolitan
areas
should
take
a
short-term
(
three-year
)
lease
and
wait
for
the
bargains
ahead
.

Mr.
Leinberger
is
managing
partner
of
a
real-estate
advisory
firm
based
in
Beverly
Hills
,
Calif
.

Kysor
Industrial
Corp.
said
it
expects
its
third-quarter
net
earnings
to
be
between
two
cents
and
four
cents
a
share
,
compared
with
61
cents
a
share
a
year
ago
.

Analysts
had
been
projecting
that
the
company
's
earnings
would
be
between
25
cents
and
30
cents
a
share
.

The
year-earlier
third-quarter
earnings
amounted
to
$
4.1
million
.

The
company
said
a
drop
in
activity
in
the
powerboat
industry
reduced
sales
volume
at
its
two
marine-related
operations
.

Also
,
the
company
said
its
commercial
products
operation
failed
to
meet
forecasts
.

Kysor
,
a
maker
of
heavy-duty
truck
and
commercial
refrigeration
equipment
,
said
it
expects
its
fourth-quarter
earnings
to
be
more
closely
in
line
with
usual
levels
,
which
are
between
30
cents
and
50
cents
a
share
.

Common
Cause
asked
both
the
Senate
Ethics
Committee
and
the
Justice
Department
to
investigate
$
1
million
in
political
gifts
by
Arizona
businessman
Charles
Keating
to
five
U.S.
senators
who
interceded
with
thrift-industry
regulators
for
him
.

Mr.
Keating
is
currently
the
subject
of
a
$
1.1
billion
federal
anti-racketeering
lawsuit
accusing
him
of
bleeding
off
assets
of
a
California
thrift
he
controlled
,
Lincoln
Savings
&
Loan
Association
,
and
driving
it
into
insolvency
.

Fred
Wertheimer
--
president
of
Common
Cause
,
the
self-styled
citizens
lobby
--
said
Mr.
Keating
already
has
conceded
attempting
to
buy
influence
with
the
lawmakers
--
Democratic
Sens.
Dennis
DeConcini
of
Arizona
,
Alan
Cranston
of
California
,
John
Glenn
of
Ohio
and
Donald
Riegle
of
Michigan
;
and
GOP
Sen.
John
McCain
of
Arizona
.

Mr.
Wertheimer
based
this
on
a
statement
by
Mr.
Keating
that
was
quoted
in
a
Wall
Street
Journal
story
in
April
:
``
One
question
...
had
to
do
with
whether
my
financial
support
in
any
way
influenced
several
political
figures
to
take
up
my
cause
.

I
want
to
say
in
the
most
forceful
way
I
can
:
I
certainly
hope
so
.
''

In
a
highly
unusual
meeting
in
Sen.
DeConcini
's
office
in
April
1987
,
the
five
senators
asked
federal
regulators
to
ease
up
on
Lincoln
.

According
to
notes
taken
by
one
of
the
participants
at
the
meeting
,
the
regulators
said
Lincoln
was
gambling
dangerously
with
depositors
'
federally
insured
money
and
was
``
a
ticking
time
bomb
.
''

Mr.
Keating
had
complained
that
the
regulators
were
being
too
zealous
.

The
notes
show
that
Sen.
DeConcini
called
the
Federal
Home
Loan
Bank
Board
's
regulations
``
grossly
unfair
,
''
and
that
Sen.
Glenn
insisted
that
Mr.
Keating
's
thrift
was
``
viable
and
profitable
.
''

For
the
next
two
years
,
the
Bank
Board
,
which
at
the
time
was
the
agency
responsible
for
regulating
thrifts
,
failed
to
act
--
even
after
federal
auditors
warned
in
May
1987
that
Mr.
Keating
had
caused
Lincoln
to
become
insolvent
.

Lincoln
's
parent
company
,
American
Continental
Corp.
,
entered
bankruptcy-law
proceedings
this
April
13
,
and
regulators
seized
the
thrift
the
next
day
.

The
newly
formed
Resolution
Trust
Corp.
,
successor
to
the
Bank
Board
,
filed
suit
against
Mr.
Keating
and
several
others
on
Sept.
15
.

Mr.
Keating
has
filed
his
own
suit
,
alleging
that
his
property
was
taken
illegally
.

The
cost
to
taxpayers
of
Lincoln
's
collapse
has
been
estimated
at
as
much
as
$
2.5
billion
.

Details
of
the
affair
have
become
public
gradually
over
the
past
two
years
,
mostly
as
a
result
of
reporting
by
several
newspapers
.

In
the
midst
of
his
1988
re-election
campaign
,
Sen.
Riegle
,
chairman
of
the
Senate
Banking
Committee
,
returned
$
76,000
in
contributions
after
a
Detroit
newspaper
said
that
Mr.
Keating
had
gathered
the
money
for
him
about
two
weeks
before
the
meeting
with
regulators
.

Sen.
DeConcini
,
after
months
of
fending
off
intense
press
criticism
,
returned
$
48,000
only
last
month
,
shortly
after
the
government
formally
accused
Mr.
Keating
of
defrauding
Lincoln
.

In
addition
,
Sen.
McCain
last
week
disclosed
that
he
belatedly
had
paid
$
13,433
to
American
Continental
as
reimbursement
for
trips
he
and
his
family
took
aboard
the
corporate
jet
to
Mr.
Keating
's
vacation
home
at
Cat
Cay
,
the
Bahamas
,
from
1984
through
1986
.

Sen.
McCain
said
he
had
meant
to
pay
for
the
trips
at
the
time
but
that
the
matter
``
fell
between
the
cracks
.
''

Mr.
Keating
,
his
family
members
and
associates
also
donated
$
112,000
to
Sen.
McCain
's
congressional
campaigns
over
the
years
,
according
to
press
accounts
.

But
Sen.
McCain
says
Mr.
Keating
broke
off
their
friendship
abruptly
in
1987
,
because
the
senator
refused
to
press
the
thrift
executive
's
case
as
vigorously
as
Mr.
Keating
wanted
.

``
He
became
very
angry
at
that
,
left
my
office
and
told
a
number
of
people
that
I
was
a
wimp
,
''
Sen.
McCain
recalls
.

In
July
,
California
newspapers
disclosed
that
Mr.
Keating
gave
$
850,000
in
corporate
funds
to
three
tax-exempt
voter
registration
organizations
in
1987
and
1988
at
the
behest
of
Sen.
Cranston
,
who
conceded
that
soliciting
the
money
was
``
a
pretty
stupid
thing
to
do
politically
.
''

In
addition
,
Sen.
Cranston
received
$
47,000
in
campaign
donations
through
Mr.
Keating
,
and
the
California
Democratic
party
received
$
85,000
in
corporate
donations
for
a
1986
get-out-the-vote
drive
that
benefited
the
senator
's
re-election
campaign
that
year
.

Also
in
July
,
Ohio
newspapers
disclosed
$
200,000
in
corporate
donations
by
Mr.
Keating
to
the
National
Council
on
Public
Policy
,
a
political
committee
controlled
by
Sen.
Glenn
.

That
was
in
addition
to
$
34,000
in
direct
campaign
donations
arranged
by
Mr.
Keating
to
the
Ohio
senator
.

Mr.
Wertheimer
said
the
Senate
Ethics
Committee
should
hire
a
special
outside
counsel
to
conduct
an
investigation
,
as
was
done
in
the
case
of
former
House
Speaker
James
Wright
.

Wilson
Abney
,
staff
director
of
the
ethics
panel
,
would
n't
comment
.

Sen.
Riegle
said
he
would
cooperate
with
any
inquiry
,
but
that
his
conduct
had
been
``
entirely
proper
.
''

Sen.
McCain
said
he
had
been
``
deeply
concerned
''
at
the
time
of
the
meeting
that
it
might
seem
to
be
improper
,
but
decided
it
was
``
entirely
appropriate
''
for
him
to
seek
fair
treatment
for
a
constituent
.

Sen.
Glenn
said
he
had
already
made
a
complete
disclosure
of
his
role
in
the
affair
and
``
I
am
completely
satisfied
to
let
this
matter
rest
in
the
hands
of
the
Senate
Ethics
Committee
.
''

Sen.
DeConcini
said
,
``
When
all
is
said
and
done
,
I
expect
to
be
fully
exonerated
.
''

Sen.
Cranston
,
who
had
already
volunteered
his
help
to
the
Federal
Bureau
of
Investigation
in
any
investigation
of
Mr.
Keating
,
portrayed
his
role
in
1987
as
prodding
regulators
to
act
.

``
Why
did
n't
the
Bank
Board
act
sooner
?
''
he
said
.

``
That
is
what
Common
Cause
should
ask
be
investigated
.

Trinity
Industries
Inc.
said
it
reached
a
preliminary
agreement
to
manufacture
1,000
coal
rail
cars
for
Norfolk
Southern
Corp
.

Trinity
estimated
the
value
of
the
pact
at
more
than
$
40
million
.

Trinity
said
it
plans
to
begin
delivery
of
the
rail
cars
in
the
first
quarter
of
1990
.

It
said
the
1,000
rail
cars
are
in
addition
to
the
1,450
coal
rail
cars
presently
being
produced
for
Norfolk
Southern
,
a
Norfolk
,
Va.-based
railroad
concern
.

When
China
opened
its
doors
to
foreign
investors
in
1979
,
toy
makers
from
Hong
Kong
were
among
the
first
to
march
in
.

Today
,
with
about
75
%
of
the
companies
'
products
being
made
in
China
,
the
chairman
of
the
Hong
Kong
Toys
Council
,
Dennis
Ting
,
has
suggested
a
new
sourcing
label
:
``
Made
in
China
by
Hong
Kong
Companies
.
''

The
toy
makers
were
pushed
across
the
border
by
rising
labor
and
land
costs
in
the
British
colony
.

But
in
the
wake
of
the
shootings
in
Beijing
on
June
4
,
the
Hong
Kong
toy
industry
is
worrying
about
its
strong
dependence
on
China
.

Although
the
manufacturers
stress
that
production
has
n't
been
affected
by
China
's
political
turmoil
,
they
are
looking
for
additional
sites
.

The
toy
makers
,
and
their
foreign
buyers
,
cite
uncertainty
about
China
's
economic
and
political
policies
.

``
Nobody
wants
to
have
all
his
eggs
in
one
basket
,
''
says
David
Yeh
,
chairman
and
chief
executive
officer
of
International
Matchbox
Group
Ltd
.

Indeed
,
Matchbox
and
other
leading
Hong
Kong
toy
makers
were
setting
up
factories
in
Southeast
Asia
,
especially
in
Thailand
,
long
before
the
massacre
.

Their
steps
were
partly
prompted
by
concern
over
a
deterioration
of
business
conditions
in
southern
China
.

By
diversifying
supply
sources
,
the
toy
makers
do
n't
intend
to
withdraw
from
China
,
manufacturers
and
foreign
buyers
say
.

It
would
n't
be
easy
to
duplicate
quickly
the
manufacturing
capacity
built
up
in
southern
China
during
the
past
decade
.

A
supply
of
cheap
labor
and
the
access
to
Hong
Kong
's
port
,
airport
,
banks
and
support
industries
,
such
as
printing
companies
,
have
made
China
's
Guangdong
province
a
premier
manufacturing
site
.

``
South
China
is
the
most
competitive
source
of
toys
in
the
world
,
''
says
Henry
Hu
,
executive
director
of
Wah
Shing
Toys
Consolidated
Ltd
.

Hong
Kong
trade
figures
illustrate
the
toy
makers
'
reliance
on
factories
across
the
border
.

In
1988
,
exports
of
domestically
produced
toys
and
games
fell
19
%
from
1987
,
to
HK$
10.05
billion
(
US$
1.29
billion
)
.

But
re-exports
,
mainly
from
China
,
jumped
75
%
,
to
HK$
15.92
billion
.

In
1989
's
first
seven
months
,
domestic
exports
fell
29
%
,
to
HK$
3.87
billion
,
while
re-exports
rose
56
%
,
to
HK$
11.28
billion
.

Manufacturers
say
there
is
no
immediate
substitute
for
southern
China
,
where
an
estimated
120,000
people
are
employed
by
the
toy
industry
.

``
For
the
next
few
years
,
like
it
or
not
,
China
is
going
to
be
the
main
supplier
,
''
says
Edmund
Young
,
vice
president
of
Perfecta
Enterprises
Ltd.
,
one
of
the
first
big
Hong
Kong
toy
makers
to
move
across
the
border
.

In
the
meantime
,
as
manufacturers
and
buyers
seek
new
sites
,
they
are
focusing
mainly
on
Southeast
Asia
.

Several
big
companies
have
established
manufacturing
joint
ventures
in
Thailand
,
including
Matchbox
,
Wah
Shing
and
Kader
Industrial
Co.
,
the
toy
manufacturer
headed
by
Mr.
Ting
.

Malaysia
,
the
Philippines
and
Indonesia
also
are
being
studied
.

With
the
European
Community
set
to
remove
its
internal
trade
barriers
in
1992
,
several
Hong
Kong
companies
are
beginning
to
consider
Spain
,
Portugal
and
Greece
as
possible
manufacturing
sites
.

Worries
about
China
came
just
as
Hong
Kong
's
toy
industry
was
recovering
from
a
1987
sales
slump
and
bankruptcy
filings
by
two
major
U.S.
companies
,
Worlds
of
Wonder
Inc.
and
Coleco
Industries
Inc
.

Hong
Kong
manufacturers
say
large
debt
writeoffs
and
other
financial
problems
resulting
from
the
1987
difficulties
chastened
the
local
industry
,
causing
it
to
tighten
credit
policies
and
financial
management
.

The
industry
regards
last
year
and
this
year
as
a
period
of
recovery
that
will
lead
to
improved
results
.

Still
,
they
long
for
a
``
mega-hit
''
toy
to
excite
retail
sales
in
the
U.S.
,
Hong
Kong
's
biggest
market
for
toys
and
games
.

The
closest
thing
the
colony
's
companies
have
to
a
U.S.
mega-hit
this
year
is
the
Teenage
Mutant
Ninja
Turtles
series
of
action
figures
manufactured
by
Playmates
Holdings
Ltd
.

Introduced
in
mid-1988
,
the
15-centimeter-tall
plastic
turtles
are
based
on
an
American
comic
book
and
television
series
.

Paul
Kwan
,
managing
director
of
Playmates
,
says
10
million
Ninja
Turtles
have
been
sold
,
placing
the
reptilian
warriors
among
the
10
biggest-selling
toys
in
the
U.S.
.

Should
sales
continue
to
be
strong
through
the
Christmas
season
,
which
accounts
for
about
60
%
of
U.S.
retail
toy
sales
,
Mr.
Kwan
said
the
Ninja
Turtles
could
make
1989
a
record
sales
year
for
Playmates
.

Other
Hong
Kong
manufacturers
expect
their
results
to
improve
only
slightly
this
year
from
1988
.

Besides
the
lack
of
a
fast-selling
product
,
they
cite
the
continued
dominance
of
the
U.S.
market
by
Nintendo
Entertainment
System
,
an
expensive
video
game
made
by
Nintendo
Co.
of
Japan
.

Nintendo
buyers
have
little
money
left
to
spend
on
other
products
.

Many
of
the
toy
makers
'
problems
started
well
before
June
4
as
a
result
of
overstrained
infrastructure
and
Beijing
's
austerity
programs
launched
late
last
year
.

Toy
makers
complain
that
electricity
in
Guangdong
has
been
provided
only
three
days
a
week
in
recent
months
,
down
from
five
days
a
week
,
as
the
province
's
rapid
industrialization
has
outstripped
its
generating
capacity
.

Manufacturers
are
upgrading
standby
power
plants
.

Bank
credit
for
China
investments
all
but
dried
up
following
June
4
.

Also
,
concern
exists
that
the
harder-line
Beijing
leadership
will
tighten
its
control
of
Guangdong
,
which
has
been
the
main
laboratory
for
the
open-door
policy
and
economic
reforms
.

But
,
toy
manufacturers
and
other
industrialists
say
Beijing
will
be
restrained
from
tightening
controls
on
export-oriented
southern
China
.

They
say
China
's
trade
deficit
is
widening
and
the
country
is
too
short
of
foreign
exchange
for
it
to
hamper
production
in
Guangdong
.

``
The
Chinese
leaders
have
to
decide
whether
they
want
control
or
whether
the
want
exports
,
''
says
Mr.
Kwan
of
Playmates
.

The
Bush
administration
,
urging
the
Supreme
Court
to
give
states
more
leeway
to
restrict
abortions
,
said
minors
have
n't
any
right
to
abortion
without
the
consent
of
their
parents
.

Solicitor
General
Kenneth
Starr
argued
that
the
1973
Supreme
Court
decision
,
Roe
vs.
Wade
,
recognizing
a
constitutional
right
to
abortion
,
was
incorrect
.

He
also
argued
that
the
high
court
was
wrong
in
1976
to
rule
that
minors
have
a
right
to
abortion
that
ca
n't
be
absolutely
vetoed
by
their
parents
.

The
administration
's
position
was
outlined
in
a
friend-of-the-court
brief
filed
in
one
of
three
abortion
cases
the
Supreme
Court
will
hear
argued
and
will
decide
this
term
.

The
administration
filed
the
brief
in
an
appeal
involving
a
Minnesota
law
that
requires
that
both
parents
of
a
minor
be
notified
before
she
may
have
an
abortion
.

The
administration
urged
the
justices
to
adopt
a
legal
standard
suggested
by
Chief
Justice
William
Rehnquist
last
July
when
the
high
court
upheld
Missouri
's
abortion
restrictions
.

Under
that
standard
,
which
garnered
the
votes
of
only
three
of
the
nine
justices
,
a
state
restriction
of
abortion
is
constitutional
if
the
state
has
a
``
reasonable
''
justification
for
adopting
it
.

That
is
a
much
easier
standard
for
a
state
to
satisfy
than
the
Supreme
Court
's
test
since
1973
,
which
requires
a
state
to
have
a
``
compelling
''
reason
for
restricting
abortion
.

On
the
provisions
of
the
Minnesota
law
,
the
Bush
administration
said
that
requiring
that
both
parents
be
notified
is
a
reasonable
regulation
,
and
that
there
is
no
need
to
have
an
alternative
that
allows
minors
to
go
to
court
for
a
judge
's
permission
instead
.

The
case
,
Hodgson
vs.
Minnesota
,
will
be
argued
Nov.
29
.

Aluminum
Co.
of
America
,
hit
hard
by
the
strength
of
the
dollar
overseas
,
said
net
income
for
the
third
quarter
dropped
3.2
%
to
$
219
million
,
or
$
2.46
a
share
.

The
nation
's
No.
1
aluminum
maker
earned
$
226.3
million
,
or
$
2.56
a
share
,
a
year
earlier
.

Revenue
rose
11
%
to
$
2.83
billion
from
$
2.56
billion
.

Analysts
,
who
were
expecting
Alcoa
to
post
around
$
2.70
to
$
3
a
share
,
were
surprised
at
the
lackluster
third-quarter
results
.

``
It
's
disappointing
,
''
said
William
Siedenburg
,
an
analyst
with
Smith
Barney
,
Harris
Upham
&
Co
.

Much
of
the
earnings
decline
was
led
by
currency-exchange
rate
adjustments
,
which
affected
the
bottom
line
by
$
15.3
million
,
or
17
cents
a
share
,
compared
with
$
3.6
million
,
or
four
cents
a
share
,
the
previous
year
.

Lower
prices
for
aluminum
ingots
and
certain
alloy
products
and
a
shift
in
the
product
mix
also
contributed
to
lower
earnings
,
the
company
said
.

``
In
addition
,
costs
were
higher
partly
due
to
scheduled
plant
outages
for
modernization
work
,
''
the
company
said
.

Excluding
the
higher
tax
rate
,
which
rose
two
percentage
points
to
38
%
,
and
the
negative
exchange
rate
adjustment
,
the
company
would
have
met
analysts
'
expectations
,
said
R.
Wayne
Atwell
,
an
analyst
with
Goldman
,
Sachs
&
Co
.

Noting
that
the
third
quarter
is
usually
the
aluminum
industry
's
slowest
,
Mr.
Atwell
added
,
``
the
third
quarter
is
never
a
bang
up
period
for
them
anyway
.
''

Nevertheless
,
the
company
said
shipments
were
up
slightly
to
679,000
metric
tons
from
671,000
,
buffing
the
impact
of
the
unexpected
earning
decline
.

The
results
were
announced
after
the
stock
market
closed
.

In
New
York
Stock
Exchange
composite
trading
Friday
,
Alcoa
closed
at
$
72
a
share
,
down
$
4.75
,
in
a
sharply
lower
market
.

For
20
years
,
federal
rules
have
barred
the
three
major
television
networks
from
sharing
in
one
of
the
most
lucrative
and
fastest-growing
parts
of
the
television
business
.

And
for
six
years
,
NBC
,
ABC
and
CBS
have
negotiated
with
Hollywood
studios
in
a
futile
attempt
to
change
that
.

But
with
foreign
companies
snapping
up
U.S.
movie
studios
,
the
networks
are
pressing
their
fight
harder
than
ever
.

They
hope
the
foreign
deals
will
divide
the
Hollywood
opposition
and
prod
Congress
to
push
for
ending
federal
rules
that
prohibit
the
networks
from
grabbing
a
piece
of
rerun
sales
and
owning
part
of
the
shows
they
put
on
the
air
.

Even
network
executives
,
however
,
admit
privately
that
victory
--
either
in
Congress
or
in
talks
with
the
studios
--
is
highly
doubtful
any
time
soon
.

And
so
the
networks
also
are
pushing
for
new
ways
to
sidestep
the
``
fin-syn
''
provisions
,
known
formally
as
the
Financial
Interest
and
Syndication
Rules
.

That
became
clear
last
week
with
the
disclosure
that
National
Broadcasting
Co.
,
backed
by
the
deep
pockets
of
parent
General
Electric
Co.
,
had
tried
to
help
fund
Qintex
Australia
Ltd.
's
now-scuttled
$
1.5
billion
bid
for
MGM\/UA
Communications
Co
.

NBC
's
interest
may
revive
the
deal
,
which
MGM\/UA
killed
last
week
when
the
Australian
concern
had
trouble
raising
cash
.

Even
if
that
deal
is
n't
revived
,
NBC
hopes
to
find
another
.

``
Our
doors
are
open
,
''
an
NBC
spokesman
says
.

NBC
may
yet
find
a
way
to
take
a
passive
,
minority
interest
in
a
program-maker
without
violating
the
rules
.

And
any
NBC
effort
could
prompt
CBS
Inc.
and
ABC
's
parent
,
Capital
Cities\/ABC
Inc.
,
to
look
for
ways
of
skirting
the
fin-syn
regulations
.

But
the
networks
'
push
may
only
aggravate
an
increasingly
bitter
rift
between
them
and
Hollywood
studios
.

Both
sides
are
to
sit
down
next
month
for
yet
another
meeting
on
how
they
might
agree
on
reducing
fin-syn
restraints
.

Few
people
privy
to
the
talks
expect
the
studios
to
budge
.

The
networks
still
are
``
uninhibited
in
their
authority
''
over
what
shows
get
on
the
air
,
charges
Motion
Picture
Association
President
Jack
Valenti
,
the
most
vociferous
opponent
of
rescinding
the
rules
.

Studios
are
``
powerless
''
to
get
shows
in
prime-time
lineups
and
keep
them
there
long
enough
to
go
into
lucrative
rerun
sales
,
he
contends
.

And
that
's
why
the
rules
,
for
the
most
part
,
must
stay
in
place
,
he
says
.

Studio
executives
in
on
the
talks
-
including
officials
at
Paramount
Communications
Inc.
,
Fries
Entertainment
Inc.
,
Warner
Communications
Inc.
and
MCA
Inc.
--
declined
to
be
interviewed
.

But
Mr.
Valenti
,
who
represents
the
studios
,
asserts
:
``
The
whole
production
industry
,
to
a
man
,
is
on
the
side
of
preserving
''
the
rules
.

Such
proclamations
leave
network
officials
all
the
more
doubtful
that
the
studios
will
bend
.

``
They
do
n't
seem
to
have
an
incentive
to
negotiate
,
''
says
one
network
executive
.

``
And
there
's
no
indication
that
Washington
is
prepared
to
address
the
rules
.

That
's
the
problem
,
is
n't
it
?
''

Indeed
it
is
.

Congress
has
said
repeatedly
it
wants
no
part
of
the
mess
,
urging
the
studios
and
the
networks
,
which
license
rights
to
air
shows
made
by
the
studios
,
to
work
out
their
own
compromise
.

But
recent
developments
have
made
the
networks
--
and
NBC
President
Robert
Wright
,
in
particular
--
ever
more
adamant
that
the
networks
must
be
unshackled
to
survive
.

The
latest
provocation
:
Sony
Corp.
's
plan
to
acquire
Columbia
Pictures
Entertainment
Inc.
for
$
3.4
billion
,
and
to
buy
independent
producer
Guber
Peters
Entertainment
Co.
for
$
200
million
.

``
I
wonder
what
Walter
Cronkite
will
think
of
the
Sony\/Columbia
Broadcast
System
Trinitron
Evening
News
with
Dan
Rather
broadcast
exclusively
from
Tokyo
,
''
wrote
J.B.
Holston
,
an
NBC
vice
president
,
in
a
commentary
in
last
week
's
issue
of
Broadcasting
magazine
.

In
his
article
,
Mr.
Holston
,
who
was
in
Europe
last
week
and
unavailable
,
complained
that
the
``
archaic
restraints
''
in
fin-syn
rules
have
``
contributed
directly
to
the
acquisition
of
the
studios
by
non-U.S.
enterprises
.

''
(
He
did
n't
mention
that
NBC
,
in
the
meantime
,
was
hoping
to
assist
Australia
's
Qintex
in
buying

An
NBC
spokesman
counters
that
Mr.
Holston
's
lament
was
``
entirely
consistent
''
with
NBC
plans
because
the
U.S.
rules
would
limit
NBC
's
involvement
in
the
Qintex
deal
so
severely
as
to
be
``
light
years
away
from
the
type
of
unrestrained
deals
available
to
Sony
--
and
everyone
else
except
the
three
networks
.
''

The
Big
Three
's
drumbeat
for
deregulation
began
intensifying
in
the
summer
when
the
former
Time
Inc.
went
ahead
with
plans
to
acquire
Warner
.

Although
Time
already
had
a
long-term
contract
to
buy
movies
from
Warner
,
the
merger
will
let
Time
's
largely
unregulated
pay-cable
channel
,
Home
Box
Office
,
own
the
Warner
movies
aired
on
HBO
--
a
vertical
integration
that
is
effectively
blocked
by
fin-syn
regulations
.

NBC
's
Mr.
Wright
led
the
way
in
decrying
the
networks
'
inability
to
match
a
Time-Warner
combination
.

He
spoke
up
again
when
the
Sony
bid
for
Columbia
was
announced
.

Since
NBC
's
interest
in
the
Qintex
bid
for
MGM\/UA
was
disclosed
,
Mr.
Wright
has
n't
been
available
for
comment
.

With
a
Qintex
deal
,
NBC
would
move
into
uncharted
territory
--
possibly
raising
hackles
at
the
studios
and
in
Washington
.

``
It
's
never
really
been
tested
,
''
says
William
Lilley
III
,
who
as
a
top
CBS
executive
spent
years
lobbying
to
have
the
rules
lifted
.

He
now
runs
Policy
Communications
in
Washington
,
consulting
to
media
companies
.

Fin-syn
rules
do
n't
explicitly
block
a
network
from
buying
a
passive
,
small
stake
in
a
company
that
profits
from
the
rerun
syndication
networks
ca
n't
enjoy
.

Hence
,
NBC
might
be
able
to
take
,
say
,
a
5
%
stake
in
a
company
such
as
MGM\/UA
.

If
the
transaction
raised
objections
,
the
studio
's
syndication
operations
could
be
spun
off
into
a
separate
firm
in
which
the
network
does
n't
have
a
direct
stake
.

But
such
convolutions
would
still
block
the
networks
from
grabbing
a
big
chunk
of
the
riches
of
syndication
.

Under
current
rules
,
even
when
a
network
fares
well
with
a
100%-owned
series
--
ABC
,
for
example
,
made
a
killing
in
broadcasting
its
popular
crime\/comedy
``
Moonlighting
''
--
it
is
n't
allowed
to
share
in
the
continuing
proceeds
when
the
reruns
are
sold
to
local
stations
.

Instead
,
ABC
will
have
to
sell
off
the
rights
for
a
one-time
fee
.

The
networks
admit
that
the
chances
of
getting
the
relief
they
want
are
slim
--
for
several
years
at
the
least
.

Six
years
ago
they
were
tantalizingly
close
.

The
Reagan-era
Federal
Communications
Commission
had
ruled
in
favor
of
killing
most
of
the
rules
.

Various
evidence
,
including
a
Brookings
Institution
study
of
some
800
series
that
the
networks
had
aired
and
had
partly
owned
in
the
1960s
,
showed
the
networks
did
n't
wield
undue
control
over
the
studios
as
had
been
alleged
.

But
just
eight
days
before
the
rules
were
to
die
,
former
President
Ronald
Reagan
,
a
one-time
actor
,
intervened
on
behalf
of
Hollywood
.

The
FCC
effort
collapsed
.

The
networks
and
studios
have
bickered
ever
since
.

Network
officials
involved
in
the
studio
talks
may
hope
the
foreign
influx
builds
more
support
in
Washington
,
but
that
seems
unlikely
.

In
Congress
,
the
issue
falters
:
It
's
about
money
,
not
program
quality
,
and
Hollywood
has
lots
of
clout
given
its
fund
raising
for
senators
and
representatives
overseeing
the
issue
.

A
spokesman
for
Rep.
Edward
J.
Markey
(
D-Mass.
)
,
who
heads
a
subcommittee
that
oversees
the
FCC
,
says
Mr.
Markey
feels
``
the
world
has
been
forever
changed
by
the
Sony-Columbia
deal
.
''

But
he
said
Mr.
Markey
hopes
this
pushes
the
networks
and
studios
to
work
it
out
on
their
own
.

And
at
the
FCC
,
meanwhile
,
new
Chairman
Alfred
C.
Sikes
has
said
he
wants
the
two
sides
to
hammer
out
their
own
plan
.

Recognition
Equipment
Inc.
said
it
settled
a
civil
action
filed
against
it
by
the
federal
government
on
behalf
of
the
U.S.
Postal
Service
.

The
government
sued
the
company
in
April
,
seeking
$
23,000
and
other
unspecified
damages
related
to
an
alleged
contract-steering
scheme
.

The
suit
named
the
company
,
former
chief
executive
officer
William
G.
Moore
Jr.
,
former
vice
president
Robert
W.
Reedy
and
five
defendants
who
were
n't
part
of
the
company
.

The
suit
charged
the
defendants
with
causing
Peter
E.
Voss
,
an
ex-member
of
the
Postal
Service
board
of
governors
,
to
accept
$
23,000
in
bribes
,
kickbacks
and
gratuities
.

Mr.
Voss
was
previously
sentenced
to
four
years
in
prison
and
fined
$
11,000
for
his
role
in
the
scheme
.

In
the
agreement
,
Recognition
agreed
to
pay
the
government
$
20,000
in
return
for
the
release
of
all
claims
against
the
company
,
Mr.
Moore
and
Mr.
Reedy
.

The
five
additional
defendants
were
n't
parties
to
the
settlement
.

A
trial
on
criminal
allegations
against
the
company
and
the
same
two
former
executives
began
Sept.
27
in
federal
court
for
the
District
of
Columbia
.

They
were
indicted
last
October
on
charges
of
fraud
,
theft
and
conspiracy
related
to
an
effort
to
win
$
400
million
in
Postal
Service
equipment
contracts
by
the
maker
of
data
management
equipment
.

The
company
and
its
executives
deny
the
charges
.

In
a
related
development
,
Recognition
Equipment
said
the
Postal
Service
has
barred
the
company
from
bidding
on
postal
contracts
for
an
additional
120
days
.

The
Postal
Service
originally
suspended
the
company
Oct.
7
,
1988
,
and
has
been
renewing
the
ban
ever
since
.

The
company
said
it
will
continue
to
pursue
a
lifting
of
the
suspension
.

Intel
Corp.
reported
a
50
%
drop
in
third-quarter
net
income
,
partly
because
of
a
one-time
charge
for
discontinued
operations
.

The
big
semiconductor
and
computer
maker
,
said
it
had
net
of
$
72
million
,
or
38
cents
,
down
50
%
from
$
142.7
million
,
or
78
cents
a
share
.

The
lower
net
included
a
charge
of
$
35
million
,
equal
to
12
cents
a
share
on
an
after-tax
basis
,
for
the
cost
of
abandoning
a
computer-systems
joint
venture
with
Siemens
AG
of
West
Germany
.

Earning
also
fell
from
the
year-ago
period
because
of
slowing
microchip
demand
.

Sales
amounted
to
$
771.4
million
,
down
1.7
%
from
$
784.9
million
.

Intel
's
stock
rose
in
early
over-the-counter
trading
Friday
,
as
investors
appeared
relieved
that
the
company
's
income
from
continuing
operations
was
only
slightly
below
the
second
quarter
's
earnings
of
$
99.3
million
,
or
53
cents
a
share
,
and
that
sales
actually
exceeded
the
$
747.3
million
for
the
second
period
.

But
Intel
later
succumbed
to
the
stock
market
's
plunge
,
closing
at
$
31.75
,
down
$
2.125
.

In
August
,
Intel
warned
that
third-quarter
earnings
might
be
``
flat
to
down
''
from
the
previous
period
's
because
of
slowing
sales
growth
of
its
80386
microprocessor
,
start-up
costs
associated
with
a
line
of
computers
and
costs
of
preparing
for
mass
shipments
of
the
company
's
new
80486
chip
in
the
current
quarter
.

On
Friday
,
Andrew
S.Grove
,
Intel
president
and
chief
executive
officer
,
said
``
Intel
's
business
is
strong
.

Our
bookings
improved
as
the
quarter
progressed
and
September
was
especially
good
.

For
the
full
quarter
,
our
bookings
were
higher
than
the
previous
quarter
,
and
our
book-to-bill
ratio
exceeded
1.0
.
''

For
the
nine-month
period
,
Intel
reported
net
of
$
268.3
million
,
or
$
1.43
a
share
,
down
27
%
from
$
367.1
million
,
or
$
2.05
a
share
.

Revenue
amounted
to
$
2.23
billion
,
up
slightly
from
$
2.15
billion
.

Walter
Sisulu
and
the
African
National
Congress
came
home
yesterday
.

After
26
years
in
prison
,
Mr.
Sisulu
,
the
77-year-old
former
secretary-general
of
the
liberation
movement
,
was
dropped
off
at
his
house
by
a
prison
services
'
van
just
as
the
sun
was
coming
up
.

At
the
same
time
,
six
ANC
colleagues
,
five
of
whom
were
arrested
with
him
in
1963
and
sentenced
to
life
imprisonment
,
were
reunited
with
their
families
at
various
places
around
the
country
.

And
as
the
graying
men
returned
to
their
homes
,
the
ANC
,
outlawed
in
South
Africa
since
1960
and
still
considered
to
be
the
chief
public
enemy
by
the
white
government
,
defiantly
returned
to
the
streets
of
the
country
's
black
townships
.

A
huge
ANC
flag
,
with
black
,
green
and
gold
stripes
,
was
hoisted
over
the
rickety
gate
at
Mr.
Sisulu
's
modest
house
,
while
on
the
street
out
front
,
boys
displayed
the
ANC
colors
on
their
shirts
,
caps
and
scarves
.

At
the
small
four-room
home
of
Elias
Motsoaledi
,
a
leading
ANC
unionist
and
a
former
commander
in
the
group
's
armed
wing
,
Umkhonto
we
Sizwe
,
well-wishers
stuck
little
ANC
flags
in
their
hair
and
a
man
tooted
on
an
antelope
horn
wrapped
in
ANC
ribbons
.

``
I
am
happy
to
see
the
spirit
of
the
people
,
''
said
Mr.
Sisulu
,
looking
dapper
in
a
new
gray
suit
.

As
the
crowd
outside
his
home
shouted
``
ANC
,
ANC
,
''
the
old
man
shot
his
fists
into
the
air
.

``
I
'm
inspired
by
the
mood
of
the
people
.
''

Under
the
laws
of
the
land
,
the
ANC
remains
an
illegal
organization
,
and
its
headquarters
are
still
in
Lusaka
,
Zambia
.

But
the
unconditional
release
of
the
seven
leaders
,
who
once
formed
the
intellectual
and
organizational
core
of
the
ANC
,
is
a
de
facto
unbanning
of
the
movement
and
the
rebirth
of
its
internal
wing
.

``
The
government
can
never
put
the
ANC
back
into
the
bottle
again
,
''
said
Cassim
Saloojee
,
a
veteran
anti-apartheid
activist
on
hand
to
welcome
Mr.
Sisulu
.

``
Things
have
gone
too
far
for
the
government
to
stop
them
now
.

There
's
no
turning
back
.
''

There
was
certainly
no
stopping
the
tide
of
ANC
emotion
last
night
,
when
hundreds
of
people
jammed
into
the
Holy
Cross
Anglican
Church
in
Soweto
for
what
became
the
first
ANC
rally
in
the
country
in
30
years
.

Deafening
chants
of
``
ANC
''
and
``
Umkhonto
we
Sizwe
''
shook
the
church
as
the
seven
aging
men
vowed
that
the
ANC
would
continue
its
fight
against
the
government
and
the
policies
of
racial
segregation
on
all
fronts
,
including
the
armed
struggle
.

And
they
called
on
the
government
to
release
Nelson
Mandela
,
the
ANC
's
leading
figure
,
who
was
jailed
with
them
and
remains
in
prison
.

Without
him
,
said
Mr.
Sisulu
,
the
freeing
of
the
others
``
is
only
a
half-measure
.
''

President
F.W.
de
Klerk
released
the
ANC
men
--
along
with
one
of
the
founding
members
of
the
Pan
Africanist
Congress
,
a
rival
liberation
group
--
as
part
of
his
efforts
to
create
a
climate
of
trust
and
peace
in
which
his
government
can
begin
negotiations
with
black
leaders
over
a
new
constitution
aimed
at
giving
blacks
a
voice
in
national
government
.

But
Pretoria
may
instead
be
creating
a
climate
for
more
turmoil
and
uncertainty
in
this
racially
divided
country
.

As
other
repressive
governments
,
particularly
Poland
and
the
Soviet
Union
,
have
recently
discovered
,
initial
steps
to
open
up
society
can
create
a
momentum
for
radical
change
that
becomes
difficult
,
if
not
impossible
,
to
control
.

As
the
days
go
by
,
the
South
African
government
will
be
ever
more
hard
pressed
to
justify
the
continued
imprisonment
of
Mr.
Mandela
as
well
as
the
continued
banning
of
the
ANC
and
enforcement
of
the
state
of
emergency
.

If
it
does
n't
yield
on
these
matters
,
and
eventually
begin
talking
directly
to
the
ANC
,
the
expectations
and
promise
raised
by
yesterday
's
releases
will
turn
to
disillusionment
and
unrest
.

If
it
does
,
the
large
number
of
right-wing
whites
,
who
oppose
any
concessions
to
the
black
majority
,
will
step
up
their
agitation
and
threats
to
take
matters
into
their
own
hands
.

The
newly
released
ANC
leaders
also
will
be
under
enormous
pressure
.

The
government
is
watching
closely
to
see
if
their
presence
in
the
townships
leads
to
increased
anti-government
protests
and
violence
;
if
it
does
,
Pretoria
will
use
this
as
a
reason
to
keep
Mr.
Mandela
behind
bars
.

Pretoria
has
n't
forgotten
why
they
were
all
sentenced
to
life
imprisonment
in
the
first
place
:
for
sabotage
and
conspiracy
to
overthrow
the
government
.

In
addition
,
the
government
is
figuring
that
the
releases
could
create
a
split
between
the
internal
and
external
wings
of
the
ANC
and
between
the
newly
freed
leaders
and
those
activists
who
have
emerged
as
leaders
inside
the
country
during
their
imprisonment
.

In
order
to
head
off
any
divisions
,
Mr.
Mandela
,
in
a
meeting
with
his
colleagues
before
they
were
released
,
instructed
them
to
report
to
the
ANC
headquarters
in
Lusaka
as
soon
as
possible
.

The
men
also
will
be
faced
with
bridging
the
generation
gap
between
themselves
and
the
country
's
many
militant
black
youths
,
the
so-called
young
lions
who
are
anxious
to
see
the
old
lions
in
action
.

Says
Peter
Mokaba
,
president
of
the
South
African
Youth
Congress
:
``
We
will
be
expecting
them
to
act
like
leaders
of
the
ANC
.
''

They
never
considered
themselves
to
be
anything
else
.

At
last
night
's
rally
,
they
called
on
their
followers
to
be
firm
,
yet
disciplined
,
in
their
opposition
to
apartheid
.

``
We
emphasize
discipline
because
we
know
that
the
government
is
very
,
very
sensitive
,
''
said
Andrew
Mlangeni
,
another
early
Umkhonto
leader
who
is
now
63
.

``
We
want
to
see
Nelson
Mandela
and
all
our
comrades
out
of
prison
,
and
if
we
are
n't
disciplined
we
may
not
see
them
here
with
us
.
